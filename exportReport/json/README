JSON in Java [package org.json]

JSON is a light-weight, language independent, data interchange format.
See http://www.JSON.org/

The files in this package implement JSON encoders/decoders in Java.
It also includes the capability to convert between JSON and XML, HTTP
headers, Cookies, and CDL.

This is a reference implementation. There is a large number of JSON packages
in Java. Perhaps someday the Java community will standardize on one. Until
then, choose carefully.

The license includes this restriction: "The software shall be used for good,
not evil." If your conscience cannot live with that, then choose a different
package.

The package compiles on Java 1.6-1.8.


JSONObject.java: The JSONObject can parse text from a String or a JSONTokener
to produce a map-like object. The object provides methods for manipulating its
contents, and for producing a JSON compliant object serialization.

JSONArray.java: The JSONObject can parse text from a String or a JSONTokener
to produce a vector-like object. The object provides methods for manipulating
its contents, and for producing a JSON compliant array serialization.

JSONTokener.java: The JSONTokener breaks a text into a sequence of individual
tokens. It can be constructed from a String, Reader, or InputStream.

JSONException.java: The JSONException is the standard exception type thrown
by this package.

JSONString.java: The JSONString interface requires a toJSONString method,
allowing an object to provide its own serialization.

JSONStringer.java: The JSONStringer provides a convenient facility for
building JSON strings.

JSONWriter.java: The JSONWriter provides a convenient facility for building
JSON text through a writer.


CDL.java: CDL provides support for converting between JSON and comma
delimited lists.

Cookie.java: Cookie provides support for converting between JSON and cookies.

CookieList.java: CookieList provides support for converting between JSON and
cookie lists.

HTTP.java: HTTP provides support for converting between JSON and HTTP headers.

HTTPTokener.java: HTTPTokener extends JSONTokener for parsing HTTP headers.

XML.java: XML provides support for converting between JSON and XML.

JSONML.java: JSONML provides support for converting between JSONML and XML.

XMLTokener.java: XMLTokener extends JSONTokener for parsing XML text.

Unit tests are maintained in a separate project. Contributing developers can test

Numeric types in this package comply with ECMA-404: The JSON Data Interchange Format 
(http://www.ecma-international.org/publications/files/ECMA-ST/ECMA-404.pdf) and 
RFC 7159: The JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) Data Interchange Format 
(https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7159#section-6). 
This package fully supports Integer, Long, and Double Java types. Partial support 
for BigInteger and BigDecimal values in JSONObject and JSONArray objects is provided 
in the form of get(), opt(), and put() API methods.

Although 1.6 compatibility is currently supported, it is not a project goal and may be
removed in some future release.
