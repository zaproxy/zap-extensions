#summary how to include dependencies in an extension

= How to Include Dependencies in your Plugin=
This page describes how you should include the jar dependencies in your extension. Dependencies are packed in the plugin jar file. To do so, you have to carry out the following two steps:

==1. Include the dependencies in the extension==
First, you have to create a new *lib* folder in *${src}/org/zaproxy/zap/extension/${extension}/*, where *${src}* is the filesystem path to the src folder of your zap-extensions project, and *${extension}* is the name of your extension. You should put in the new lib folder all the jar dependencies of your plugin. _Note_: this new lib folder is not in classpath in your zap-extensions project. Therefore, you might need to either include its path in classpath or to also copy these jars in the zap-extensions/lib folder of your project. 

==2. Make the specific antcall in build.xml==
Second, you have to edit the *build.xml* file of the project and include the following lines:
{{{
<target name="build-pluginName" description="build the pluginName extension">
     <antcall target="build-extensionAndDeps">
          <param name="extension" value="pluginName"/>
          <param name="type" value="alpha"/>
          <param name="version" value="1"/>
     </antcall>
</target>
}}}
This will call the build-extensionAndDeps target that is defined as follows:
{{{
<target name="build-extensionAndDeps" description="build the specified extension and include its dependencies">
     <jar jarfile="${dist}/zap-ext-${extension}-${type}-${version}.jar" update="true" compress="false">
          <zipfileset dir="${build}" prefix="">
               <include name="org/zaproxy/zap/extension/${extension}/**" />
          </zipfileset>
          <zipgroupfileset dir="${src}/org/zaproxy/zap/extension/${extension}/lib/" includes="*.jar" />
          <zipfileset dir="${src}" prefix="">
               <include name="org/zaproxy/zap/extension/${extension}/Messages*" />
          </zipfileset>
     </jar>
</target>
}}}
If your plugin did not have to pack dependencies, you would need to use <code> <antcall target="build-extension"> </code> instead of <code><antcall target="build-extensionAndDeps"> </code>.
