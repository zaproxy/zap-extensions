ascanalpha.backupfiledisclosure.soln = Do not edit files in-situ on the web server, and ensure that un-necessary files (including hidden files) are removed from the web server.
ascanalpha.backupfiledisclosure.evidence = A backup of [{0}] is available at [{1}]

ascanalpha.elinjection.name = Expression Language Injection
ascanalpha.elinjection.desc = The software constructs all or part of an expression language (EL) statement in a Java Server Page (JSP) using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the intended EL statement before it is executed. In certain versions of Spring 3.0.5 and earlier, there was a vulnerability (CVE-2011-2730) in which Expression Language tags would be evaluated twice, which effectively exposed any application to EL injection. However, even for later versions, this weakness is still possible depending on configuration.
ascanalpha.elinjection.soln = Perform data validation best practice against untrusted input and to ensure that output encoding is applied when data arrives on the EL layer, so that no metacharacter is found by the interpreter within the user content before evaluation. The most obvious patterns to detect include ${ and #{, but it may be possible to encode or fragment this data.
ascanalpha.elinjection.refs = https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Expression_Language_Injection\nhttp://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/917.html

ascanalpha.heartbleed.name=Heartbleed OpenSSL Vulnerability
ascanalpha.heartbleed.desc=The TLS implementation in OpenSSL 1.0.1 before 1.0.1g does not properly handle Heartbeat Extension packets, which allows remote attackers to obtain sensitive information from process memory via crafted packets that trigger a buffer over-read, potentially disclosing sensitive information.
ascanalpha.heartbleed.soln=Update to OpenSSL 1.0.1g or later. Re-issue HTTPS certificates. Change asymmetric private keys and shared secret keys, since these may have been compromised, with no evidence of compromise in the server log files.
ascanalpha.heartbleed.refs=http://cvedetails.com/cve-details.php?t=1&cve_id=CVE-2014-0160
ascanalpha.heartbleed.extrainfo=This issue was confirmed by exfiltrating data from the server, using {0}. This is unlikely to be a false positive.

#the refs cannot be customised for each sub-category (Adobe, Silverlight, etc)
ascanalpha.crossdomain.refs = http://www.adobe.com/devnet/articles/crossdomain_policy_file_spec.html\nhttp://www.adobe.com/devnet-docs/acrobatetk/tools/AppSec/CrossDomain_PolicyFile_Specification.pdf\nhttp://msdn.microsoft.com/en-US/library/cc197955%28v=vs.95%29.aspx\nhttp://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc838250%28v=vs.95%29.aspx
ascanalpha.crossdomain.adobe.read.name = Cross-Domain Misconfiguration - Adobe - Read
ascanalpha.crossdomain.adobe.send.name = Cross-Domain Misconfiguration - Adobe - Send
ascanalpha.crossdomain.adobe.desc = Flash/Silverlight based cross-site request forgery may be possible, due to a misconfiguration on the web server. 
ascanalpha.crossdomain.adobe.read.soln = Configure the crossdomain.xml file to restrict the list of domains that are allowed to make cross-domain read requests to this web server, using <allow-access-from domain="example.com">. You should only grant access to "*" (all domains) if you are certain that this service does not host any access-controlled, personalized, or private data.
ascanalpha.crossdomain.adobe.read.extrainfo = The web server permits malicious cross-domain data read requests originating from Flash/Silverlight components served from any third party domain, to this domain. If the victim user is logged into this service, the malicious read requests are processed using the privileges of the victim, and can result in data from this service being compromised by an unauthorised third party web site, via the victim's web browser. This is particularly likely to be an issue if a Cookie based session implementation is in use. 
ascanalpha.crossdomain.adobe.send.soln = Configure the crossdomain.xml file to restrict the list of domains that are allowed to make cross-domain send (but not necessarily read) requests to this web server, using <allow-http-request-headers-from domain="example.com" headers="Authorization,X-Blahh">. You should only grant access to "*" (all domains) if you are certain that this service that this service is not vulnerable to Cross Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks.
ascanalpha.crossdomain.adobe.send.extrainfo = The web server permits malicious cross-domain data send (but not necessarily read) requests originating from Flash/Silverlight components served from any third party domain, to this domain. If the victim user is logged into this service, the malicious send requests are processed using the privileges of the victim, and can result in Cross Site Request Forgery (CSRF) type attacks, via the victim's web browser. This is particularly likely to be an issue if a Cookie based session implementation is in use.
ascanalpha.crossdomain.silverlight.name = Cross-Domain Misconfiguration - Silverlight
ascanalpha.crossdomain.silverlight.desc = Silverlight based cross-site request forgery may be possible, due to a misconfiguration on the web server.
ascanalpha.crossdomain.silverlight.soln = Configure the clientaccesspolicy.xml file to restrict the list of domains that are allowed to make cross-domain requests to this web server, using <domain uri="https://example.com" />. You should only grant access to "*" (all domains) if you are certain that this service does not host any access-controlled, personalized, or private data.
ascanalpha.crossdomain.silverlight.extrainfo = The web server permits malicious cross-domain requests originating from Silverlight components served from any third party domain, to this domain. If the victim user is logged into this service, the malicious requests are processed using the privileges of the victim, and can result in data from this service being compromised by an unauthorised third party web site, via the victim's web browsers. It can also result in Cross Site Request Forgery (CSRF) type attacks. This is particularly likely to be an issue if a Cookie based session implementation is in use.

ascanalpha.cookieslack.name = Cookie Slack Detector
ascanalpha.cookieslack.desc = Repeated GET requests: drop a different cookie each time, followed by normal request with all cookies to stabilize session, compare responses against original baseline GET. This can reveal areas where cookie based authentication/attributes are not actually enforced.
ascanalpha.cookieslack.solution = N.a.
ascanalpha.cookieslack.otherinfo.intro = Cookies that don't have expected effects can reveal flaws in application logic. In the worst case, this can reveal where authentication via cookie token(s) is not actually enforced.\n
ascanalpha.cookieslack.session.warning = NOTE: Because of its name this cookie may be important, but dropping it appears to have no effect: [{0}] \n
ascanalpha.cookieslack.affect.response.yes = These cookies affected the response: 
ascanalpha.cookieslack.affect.response.no = These cookies did NOT affect the response: 
ascanalpha.cookieslack.session.destroyed = Dropping this cookie appears to have invalidated the session: [{0}] A follow-on request with all original cookies still had a different response than the original request. \n
ascanalpha.cookieslack.separator = ,
ascanalpha.cookieslack.endline = \n

ascanalpha.insecurehttpmethod.name = Insecure HTTP Method
ascanalpha.insecurehttpmethod.detailed.name = Insecure HTTP Method - {0}
ascanalpha.insecurehttpmethod.desc = The insecure HTTP method [{0}] is enabled on the web server for this resource. Depending on the web server configuration, and the underlying implementation responsible for serving the resource, this might or might not be exploitable. The TRACK and TRACE methods may be used by an attacker, to gain access to the authorisation token/session cookie of an application user, even if the session cookie is protected using the 'HttpOnly' flag. For the attack to be successful, the application user must typically be using an older web browser, or a web browser which has a Same Origin Policy (SOP) bypass vulnerability. The 'CONNECT' method can be used by a web client to create an HTTP tunnel to third party websites or services.
ascanalpha.insecurehttpmethod.trace.exploitable.desc = The insecure HTTP method [{0}] is enabled for this resource, and is exploitable. The TRACK and TRACE methods may be used by an attacker, to gain access to the authorisation token/session cookie of an application user, even if the session cookie is protected using the 'HttpOnly' flag. For the attack to be successful, the application user must typically be using an older web browser, or a web browser which has a Same Origin Policy (SOP) bypass vulnerability.
ascanalpha.insecurehttpmethod.connect.exploitable.desc = The insecure HTTP method [{0}] is enabled for this resource, and is exploitable. It was found to be possible to establish a tunneled socket connection to a third party service, using this HTTP method.  This would allow the service to be used as an anonymous spam relay, or as a web proxy, bypassing network restrictions. It also allows it to be used to establish a tunneled VPN, effectively extending the network perimeter to include untrusted components. 
ascanalpha.insecurehttpmethod.extrainfo = The OPTIONS method disclosed the following enabled HTTP methods for this resource: [{0}]
ascanalpha.insecurehttpmethod.trace.exploitable.extrainfo = A TRACE request was sent for this request, with a custom cookie value [{0}]. This cookie value was disclosed in the HTTP response, confirming the vulnerability.
ascanalpha.insecurehttpmethod.connect.exploitable.extrainfo = The CONNECT method was used to establish a socket connection to [{0}], via the web server.
ascanalpha.insecurehttpmethod.soln = Disable insecure methods such as TRACK, TRACE, and CONNECT on the web server, and ensure that the underlying service implementation does not support insecure methods.

ascanalpha.sourcecodedisclosurewebinf.name = Source Code Disclosure - /WEB-INF folder
ascanalpha.sourcecodedisclosurewebinf.desc = Java source code was disclosed by the web server in Java class files in the WEB-INF folder. The class files can be dis-assembled to produce source code which very closely matches the original source code.  
ascanalpha.sourcecodedisclosurewebinf.soln = The /WEB-INF folder should be not be accessible from the end user's web browser, since it contains sensitive information such as compiled Java source code and properties files which may contain credentials. Java classes deployed with the application should be obfuscated, as an additional layer of defence in a "defence-in-depth" approach.
