This project contains extensions for the [OWASP Zed Attack Proxy](https://code.google.com/p/zaproxy) (ZAP).

It has just been migrated from Google Code, so some of the wiki links may well be broken - we will fix these in time ;)

If you are using the latest version of ZAP  then you can browse and download addons from within ZAP by clicking on this button in the toolbar:

You can also import add-ons you have downloaded manually via the "File / Load Add-on file..." menu option.

This project also contains [example templates](Examples) to help you get started when developing new ZAP extensions.

For a summary of the ways you can extend ZAP see https://code.google.com/p/zaproxy/wiki/DevExtending

For some general notes on developing ZAP see the [wiki](https://code.google.com/p/zaproxy/wiki/Development)

If you have any questions about developing extensions for ZAP please ask them on the [ZAP Developer](http://groups.google.com/group/zaproxy-develop) forum.

We are happy to host the source code and/or release jars for your ZAP extensions in this project - please get in touch via the [ZAP Developer](http://groups.google.com/group/zaproxy-develop) forum.
