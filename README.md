This project contains extensions for the [OWASP Zed Attack Proxy](https://code.google.com/p/zaproxy) (ZAP).

It has just been migrated from Google Code, so some of the wiki links may well be broken - we will fix these in time ;)

If you are using the latest version of ZAP  then you can browse and download addons from within ZAP by clicking on this button in the toolbar:

You can also import add-ons you have downloaded manually via the "File / Load Add-on file..." menu option.

Please see the [wiki](https://github.com/zaproxy/zap-extensions/wiki) for more details.
