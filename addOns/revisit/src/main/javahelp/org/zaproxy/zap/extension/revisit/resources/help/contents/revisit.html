<p>
Have you ever wanted to be able to browse an application you tested with ZAP at a specific time, 
perhaps when you dont have access to it, or after its been changed in some way?<br>
If so then this add-on is for you!
</p>
<p>
The add-on allows you to instruct ZAP to return content from the ZAP history between specified
dates rather than forwarding the requests to the site.<br>
This allows you to apparently browse and use a website that you no longer have access to.<br>
It also allows you to see what it looked like at between specific times, which is useful if 
the application has since changed.<br>
<br>
When returning pages from the ZAP history floating footers are injected into HTML pages to
give a visual clue that these pages are generated from ZAP.<br>
ZAP will return pages that were the result of both GET and POST requests as long as it finds ones that match.<br>
Pages only match if all URL and POST parameters are the same, ignoring the order and any known CSRF tokens.<br>
If no matching page can be found in the history then a custom 404 page is returned which will
include links to the same page if it has been invoked with different parameters or outside of the time period specified.<br>
<br>
This add-on adds right click menus to the Sites tree:
</p>
<H3>Enable Revisit</H3>
When selected a popup will be shown which asks for the start and end times to be used.<br>
The start time defaults to the time of the first request in the session.<br>
The end time defaults to the time of the last request in the session.<br>
If any of the time elements (for example 'day of the month') have not changed then those elements will be disabled.<br>
If the dialog OK button is pressed then the revisit functionality will be enabled for the selected site,
and a 'calendar' icon added to the site node in the History tree.

<H3>Disable Revisit</H3>
When selected then the revisit functionality will be disabled for the selected site.

<H2>API</H2>
The add on supports the following API endpoints:<br><br>
revisit / view / revisitList Returns the list of sites enabled for revisit<br>
revisit / action / revisitSiteOn Turns revisit on for the specified site. Dates must use the format: "yyyy/MM/dd HH:mm:ss"<br> 
revisit / action / revisitSiteOff  Turns revisit off for the specified site
