<H1>Authentication Helper</H1>

This add-on helps identify and set up authentication handling in ZAP.<br>
It is initially aimed at manual use but the end goal is to make all of the key features available via automation.<br>
It is currently at a very early stage of development - feedback on the existing functionality is very much appreciated,
especially details of commonly used username and password fields in languages other than English.
<p>

The add-on can be used in 2 ways:
<ul>
<li>To passively detect authentication features.
<li>To automatically configure ZAP to handle the authentication features discovered.
</ul>

The features currently supported are:
<ul>
<li><a href="auth-req-id.html">Authentication Request Identification</a>
<li><a href="autodetect-auth.html">Auto-Detect Authentication</a>
<li><a href="browser-auth.html">Browser Based Authentication</a>
<li><a href="session-mgmt-id.html">Session Management Identification</a>
<li><a href="autodetect-session.html">Auto-Detect Session Management</a>
<li><a href="session-header.html">Header Based Session Management</a>
</ul>

However if any of the authentication features are part of a ZAP Context which uses the "Manual" authentication method (the default),
then the add-on will update that context to handle the authentication features if possible.
<p>
This add-on does not currently perform any exploring on its own - it relies upon requests being proxied through ZAP
(e.g. via a browser being manually controlled, or integration tests) or requests being generated by ZAP 
(e.g. via the traditional or AJAX spiders).
<p>
To automatically configure authentication handling in ZAP:
<ol>
<li>Launch your preferred browser (Firefox or Chrome) from ZAP
<li>Open your app in the browser
<li>Add all of the sites your app uses to a ZAP Context
<li>Change the contect to use "Auto-Detect" Authentication and Session Management
<li>Authenticate to your app via the browser using valid credentials
</ol>
