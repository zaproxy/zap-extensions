		<H1>Form Handler</H1>
			<p>
				This Form Handler extension allows for the custom configuration of values used in forms based on field names.
			</p>

		<H2>Description</H2>
			<p>
				With this add-on the user can create new fields for each individual field that they wish to set the 
				value of. Additionally, the user can modify any existing field's name and value to fit the field that 
				they are trying to set. Any field can also be disabled or removed by the user so that the custom values 
				are not used. Field names, values and enabled status will be stored even after a ZAP session has 
				concluded.
			</p>
			<p>
				The add-on provides a set of default field names that may be found on a form and a corresponding 
				value for each default field. These default values can be disabled, modified and deleted if the 
				user desires.
			</p>

		<H2>Using The Form Handler</H2>
			<p>
				The Form Handler can be found in the Options. Selecting the Form Handler tab will display a table 
				with all existing values that are currently defined. An example is shown below.

		<H3>Adding A New Field</H3>
			<p>
				To define additional field values the <b>Add</b> button can be clicked. This will bring up a dialog 
				for the user to provide field information.
			</p>

			<p>
				Please take note of the following when adding a new field:
				<ul>
					<li>A field name must be provided.</li>
					<li>The field name cannot already exist in the table or a warning error will occur.</li>
					<li>The field name supplied to the Form Handler must match the field ID on the form that you wish 
						to define.</li>
					<li>The field name is not case sensitive.</li>
					<li>A value does not have to be provided. This will result in an empty string being used.</li>
					<li>The value field is case sensitive, and will be seen in the POST.</li>
				</ul>
			</p>

		<H3>Modifying An Existing Field</H3>
			<p>
				The extension allows the user to modify the values and names of existing fields. This can be done 
				by selecting the field that you wish to modify and clicking on the <b>Modify</b> button.
			</p>

			<p>
				When modifying a field the user is constrained by the same rules as creating a new one. The most
				common constraint when modifying a field is that the name cannot be the same as an existing field.
				(i.e. No duplicate fields)
			<p>
 
		<H3>Removing Fields</H3>
			<p>
				The user can remove fields at any time. To do so simply select the field that you wish to remove and 
				click on the <b>Remove</b> button. <i> Please note that you will be prompted to confirm removal before 
				proceeding unless the <b>Remove without Confirmation</b> box is checked.</i> 
			</p>

		<H2>Form Fields That Are Not Defined</H2>
			<p>
				A user may find that they do not want to define every field in a form, but rather define a select few within 
				the form.
			</p>
			<p>
				Any field that is not defined in the form handler add-on will use a ZAP default value that is generated to match 
				each field type.(For example: A text field will have the value "ZAP")
