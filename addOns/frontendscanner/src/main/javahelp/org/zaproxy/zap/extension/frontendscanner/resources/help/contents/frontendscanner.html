<H1>Front-End Scanner</H1>

When installed and enabled, the Front-End Scanner add-on tampers with all HTTP responses passing through ZAP to inject a piece of JavaScript code containing custom logic, utility functions and scripts that ZAP users wish to run in the browser to help them audit front-end applications.


<H2>Add a script to be run in the browser</H2>

<STRONG>Note:</STRONG> as for now, only "Client-Side Passive" scripts are injected in web pages.

<P>
To add a passive script, go to the "Scripts" pane and right click on "Client-side Passive Rules", then "New Script...".
Give your script a meaningful name, make sure that you use the template "scan.js" and save.
</P>
<P>
As they will be executed in a web browser, scripts need to be written in Javascript.
For the same reason, they can make use of the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API">Web APIs</a> exposed by the browser that you use.
</P>
<P>
Each user script, written via ZAP's interface, ends up wrapped in a function in the front-end, receiving a Javascript object (FrontEndScanner) as a parameter. Thus, scripts have access to what this object exposes:
<UL>
  <LI>ZAP constants to help scripts create alerts,</LI>
  <LI>the “mailbox”: a “publish-subscribe” mechanism to help scripts react to events happening in the browser (such as user interactions, Storage accesses, etc.),</LI>
  <LI>a helper function to report findings back to ZAP.</LI>
</UL>
All the functions containing user (passive) scripts will be executed automatically in the browser.
</P>


<H2>Enabling - Disabling</H2>

To toggle the add-on, go to "Tools" then "Toggle Front-End Scanner" (note that the add-on is turned off by default).

<P>
<STRONG>Note:</STRONG> Only enabled scripts will be injected in the targeted web pages.
To enable (or disable) particular scripts, right click on them in the "Scripts" pane, then "Enable Script(s)" (or respectively "Disable Script(s)").
</P>
