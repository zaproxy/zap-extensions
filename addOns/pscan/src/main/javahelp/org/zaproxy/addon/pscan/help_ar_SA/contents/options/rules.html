<H3>Threshold</H3>
This controls how likely ZAP is to report potential vulnerabilities.<br>
<ul>
	<li>If you select Off then the scan rule won't run.</li>
	<li>If you select Low then more potential issues will be raised which may increase the number of false positives.</li>
	<li>If you select High then fewer potential issues will be raised which may mean that some real issues are missed (false negatives).</li>
</ul>
