<h1>Code Dx</h1>
The Code Dx add-on allows you to generate compatible reports and upload them to a Code Dx server. There are two options under the Report menu.

<h2>Code Dx: Upload Report</h2>
This option will generate a report for you and upload it to a Code Dx server. Selecting it will prompt you for the Server URL and API Key. After populating the fields, click the refresh button to get a list of projects available to the API Key. Then click the Upload button to send results to the Code Dx server.

<h2>Code Dx: Generate XML Report</h2>
This option will generate a standard XML report that includes the HTTP request and response data.
