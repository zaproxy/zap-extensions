# This file contains advanced fuzzing payloads designed to extract hyperparameter information from LLMs.
# The goal is to determine if the LLM reveals specific hyperparameters, such as learning rates, 
# optimizer types, batch sizes, and more, through adversarial prompts.
# AI-RMM documentation: https://osf.io/kb8a5/
#
# Hyperparameter Extraction: These payloads probe for learning rates, optimizer settings, 
# and training schedules used during model development.
#
# Learning rates - Payloads focus on extracting the learning rate and its schedule.
# Optimizer and hyperparameters - Probes for optimizer types, momentum, beta values, and weight 
# decay settings.
# Training specifics - Queries related to batch size, epochs, gradient clipping, and dropout rates.
# Training techniques - Attempts to infer whether early stopping, data augmentation, or mixed-precision 
# training were used.
