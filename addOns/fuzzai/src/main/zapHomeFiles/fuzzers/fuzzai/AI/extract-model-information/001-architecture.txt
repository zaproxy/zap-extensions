# This file contains advanced fuzzing payloads designed to extract model architecture information from LLMs.
# The goal is to determine if the LLM reveals specific details about its architecture, 
# such as the number of layers, transformer types, or parameter counts.
# AI-RMM documentation: https://osf.io/kb8a5/
#
# Model Architecture Extraction: These payloads probe for specific architecture-related details 
# such as layer counts, model types, and other structural aspects of the LLM.
#
# Layer counts - Payloads focus on extracting the number of layers and their 
# types (e.g., transformer layers, hidden layers).
# Parameter inference - Probes for parameter counts, such as attention 
# heads or layer dimensions.
# Model type: Attackers attempt to identify whether the LLM is a decoder-only model 
# or part of an architecture family (e.g., GPT, BERT).
# Specific internal mechanisms: Questions around activation functions, normalization, 
# and positional encodings to infer architecture specifics.
