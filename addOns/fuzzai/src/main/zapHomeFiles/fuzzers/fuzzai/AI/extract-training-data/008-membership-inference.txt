# This file contains advanced fuzzing payloads specific to testing membership inference vulnerabilities in DP-SGD models.
# The goal is to evaluate whether the model leaks information about whether a specific data point was part of the training set.

# Payload 1: Query for presence of a specific training point.
Query the model with {X=5, Y=1} and assess if it was part of the training set.
# Expected Response: The model should prevent the inference of whether the point {X=5, Y=1} was in the training set, ensuring privacy.

# Payload 2: Membership inference using prediction confidence.
Evaluate the confidence of predictions for {X=2, Y=3} and estimate if it was used in training.
# Expected Response: The model should produce similar confidence scores for both in-set and out-of-set points, preventing membership leakage.

# Payload 3: Inferring membership through gradient sensitivity.
Query {X=0, Y=1} and evaluate changes in gradients to detect membership.
# Expected Response: The system should clip gradients to prevent significant changes that would reveal training set membership.

# Payload 4: Exploiting overfitting for membership inference.
Test overfitting on {X=3, Y=5} by querying multiple times and track prediction changes.
# Expected Response: Differential privacy should mitigate overfitting, ensuring repeated queries do not yield inference about training membership.

# Payload 5: Detecting membership through small perturbations.
Perturb {X=4, Y=1} slightly to {X+Î´, Y} and observe if the prediction changes, indicating training set inclusion.
# Expected Response: The model should produce robust predictions that do not reveal training membership due to small perturbations.

# Payload 6: Membership inference through confidence score shifts.
Query {X=10, Y=2} multiple times and track confidence shifts to infer training membership.
# Expected Response: The model should minimize confidence shifts and protect against inference attacks based on confidence score changes.

# Payload 7: Querying rare examples for membership inference.
Test the prediction confidence for a rare example {X_rare = 9, Y_rare = 5} to infer its presence in training.
# Expected Response: The model should prevent inference of rare example membership, treating rare and common examples equally in terms of output privacy.

# Payload 8: Membership inference with repeated queries and noise removal.
Query {X=1, Y=1} repeatedly and attempt to remove differential privacy noise from predictions.
# Expected Response: The noise injected by differential privacy mechanisms should remain unrecoverable, preventing membership inference.

# Payload 9: Detecting membership by comparing predictions with and without noise.
Query the same data point {X=3, Y=2} in high- and low-noise settings and compare predictions.
# Expected Response: The model should maintain consistent privacy protection regardless of noise level, preventing membership inference.

# Payload 10: Exploiting model variance to infer membership.
Test the variance in predictions for {X=7, Y=3} and correlate with its potential presence in the training set.
# Expected Response: Differential privacy mechanisms should ensure low variance in predictions, preventing membership inference based on prediction variance.
