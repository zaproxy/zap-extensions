# Gradient Clipping: Payloads explore whether gradient clipping sufficiently prevents large gradients from revealing sensitive information or influencing the model.

# Payload 1: Overcoming gradient clipping by introducing high-gradient points.
Add points {X=10, Y=target} with high gradients and evaluate if clipping restricts their influence.
# Expected Response: The model should successfully clip the gradients, ensuring that high-gradient points do not significantly influence the model.

# Payload 2: Testing gradient clipping under extreme outlier values.
Insert {X=100, Y='extreme'} into the dataset and track the gradient clipping behavior.
# Expected Response: The system should clip gradients to maintain model stability despite the introduction of extreme outliers.

# Payload 3: Monitoring gradient variance with subtle perturbations.
Introduce slight perturbations {X+δ, Y} and observe if gradient clipping mitigates their impact.
# Expected Response: Gradient clipping should prevent the small perturbations from excessively influencing the model, ensuring privacy is upheld.

# Payload 4: Clipping under adversarial gradient manipulation.
Add adversarial points {X_adv = X + ε, Y_adv} and evaluate if clipping restricts their effect.
# Expected Response: The model should maintain robust gradient clipping, preventing adversarial points from disproportionately influencing model updates.

# Payload 5: Querying gradient sensitivity post-clipping.
Test sensitivity of gradients to {X=1, Y=1} after clipping and compare to unclipped versions.
# Expected Response: The model should ensure
