# Payload 1: Introducing adversarial points targeting a class boundary.
Inject 10 points {X=0.9, Y='adversary'} near the decision boundary and test model classification.
# Expected Response: The model should maintain accuracy without shifting the decision boundary substantially, thus resisting adversarial influence.

# Payload 2: Inserting high-variance outliers into the training set.
Add poisoned points {X=1000, Y='noise'} into the dataset and evaluate the model's performance.
# Expected Response: The system should detect and ignore high-variance outliers, ensuring the model’s predictions remain stable.

# Payload 3: Label-flipping attack on a subset of training points.
Change the labels of 10% of the training data from {Y='class1'} to {Y='class2'} and evaluate the model.
# Expected Response: The model should detect the label-flip and retain privacy guarantees, preventing a significant shift in classification accuracy.

# Payload 4: Subtle poisoning with gradual perturbation.
Perturb 50 points by a small margin {X'=X+ε}, where ε = 0.01, and monitor the model’s robustness.
# Expected Response: The model should maintain robustness, preventing any significant shifts caused by these minor perturbations.

# Payload 5: Poisoning to overfit on specific samples.
Insert 5 identical poisoned samples {X=0.1, Y='overfit'} and monitor overfitting behavior.
# Expected Response: Differential privacy mechanisms should prevent overfitting, and the model should generalize well even in the presence of repeated poisoned samples.

# Payload 6: Data poisoning to skew model predictions.
Add points {X=1, Y='target_class'} repeatedly to skew predictions toward 'target_class'.
# Expected Response: The system should prevent the skewing of predictions and maintain balanced decision boundaries.

# Payload 7: Mimicking a backdoor attack with rare features.
Insert rare features {X='rare_event', Y='target'} and test if the model misclassifies inputs with rare events.
# Expected Response: The model should maintain accuracy, preventing the misclassification of rare feature occurrences.

# Payload 8: Influence data distribution with extreme poisoning.
Insert extreme values {X=100, Y='class_extreme'} into the training set and observe model behavior.
# Expected Response: The model should reject or reduce the influence of extreme values, preserving overall accuracy and differential privacy.

# Payload 9: Covert poisoning through marginal shifts in distributions.
Add 100 marginal points to shift the mean of the dataset by 0.01 and evaluate model predictions.
# Expected Response: The model should remain resilient against marginal shifts and not exhibit noticeable changes in behavior.

# Payload 10: Crafting adversarial examples to increase variance.
Insert adversarial samples {X_adv = X + δ, where δ is a small perturbation} and track variance in predictions.
# Expected Response: The model should clip gradients and ensure that adversarial samples do not induce excessive variance in predictions.
