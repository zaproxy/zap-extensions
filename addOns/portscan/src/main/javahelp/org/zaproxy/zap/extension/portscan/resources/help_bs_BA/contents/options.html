	<h1>Options Port Scan screen</h1>
	<p>This screen allows you to configure the port scan options:
	<h3>Highest port number to scan</h3>
	ZAP will start from 1 and work up to this port number.
	<br> Selecting a high number will significantly increase the time a port scan takes.

	<h3>Concurrent scanning threads per host</h3>
	The number of threads the scanner will use per host.
	<br> Increasing the number of threads will speed up the scan but may put extra
	strain on the computer ZAP is running on and the target host.
