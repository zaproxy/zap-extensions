httpsinfo.beast.name=HTTPSInfo: Beast Vulnerability
httpsinfo.beast.desc=Beast (Browser Exploit Against SSL/TLS) is an exploit revealed in 2011, that takes advantage of weaknesses in cipher block chaining (CBC) to exploit the SSL protocol. The vulnerability can enable man-in-the-middle (MiTM) attacks against encrypted HTTP traffic in order to decrypt traffic and obtain sensitive information. SSL3 and TLSv1 are affected.
httpsinfo.beast.refs=https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=cve-2011-3389\nhttp://www.bolet.org/TestSSLServer/
httpsinfo.beast.soln=Disable use of SSLv3 and TLSv1 in favour of TLSv1.1 and TLSv1.2 (or later).
httpsinfo.crime.name=HTTPSInfo: Crime Vulnerability
httpsinfo.crime.desc=CRIME (Compression Ratio Info-leak Made Easy) is a security exploit against web cookies over connections using the HTTPS and SPDY protocols that also use data compression. When used to recover the content of authentication or session management cookies, it allows an attacker to perform session hijacking on an authenticated web session (user impersonation). CRIME was assigned CVE-2012-4929.
httpsinfo.crime.refs=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CRIME
httpsinfo.crime.soln=Most modern clients (web browsers) have implemented mitigations against this attack. Server based mitigations include disabling SPDY, HTTP Compression, or TLS Compression (though such solutions obviously carry their own potential performance impacts). 
httpsinfo.warn.outgoing.proxy.enabled=ZAP is currently configured to use an outbound proxy. {0} results may be inaccurate. That is, they may be based on the connection to the proxy instead of the connection to the target.
