<h1>HTTPS Info</h1>

<p>
The HTTPS Info add-on is accessed via the context menu within the Sites Tree or History table. 
It displays tabs in a status panel, in which various summary information is displayed
regarding the target server's HTTPS certificate, and the offered SSL/TLS cipher suites.
</p>

<p>
This add-on leverages another OWASP project: 
<a href="https://github.com/spoofzu/DeepViolet/">Deep Violet</a> 
to perform it's certificate and cipher suite information gathering.
</p>

<h2>General</h2>
The top portion of a tab is devoted to general details of the SSL/TLS certificate presented by the server. Such as:
<ul>
<li>Subject DN</li>
<li>Signing Algorithm</li>
<li>Certificate Fingerprint</li>
<li>Issuer DN</li>
<li>Validity Dates</li>
<li>Self-signed Status</li>
<li>etc.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Cipher Suites</h2>
The bottom portion of a tab is devoted to enumeration/listing of the specific Cipher Suites the 
target server offers, grouped by handshake protocol (SSLv2, SSLv3, TLSv1, TLSv1.1, etc.).
