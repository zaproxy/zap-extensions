ascanrules.desc = Active Scan Rules

ascanrules.bufferoverflow.name = Buffer Overflow
ascanrules.bufferoverflow.desc = Buffer overflow errors are characterized by the overwriting of memory spaces of the background web process, which should have never been modified intentionally or unintentionally. Overwriting values of the IP (Instruction Pointer), BP (Base Pointer) and other registers causes exceptions, segmentation faults, and other process errors to occur. Usually these errors end execution of the application in an unexpected way. 
ascanrules.bufferoverflow.soln = Rewrite the background program using proper return length checking.  This will require a recompile of the background executable.

ascanrules.sourcecodedisclosurewebinf.soln = The web server should be configured to not serve the /WEB-INF folder or its contents to web browsers, since it contains sensitive information such as compiled Java source code and properties files which may contain credentials. Java classes deployed with the application should be obfuscated, as an additional layer of defence in a "defence-in-depth" approach.

This does not eliminate SQL injection, but minimizes its impact.\nGrant the minimum database access that is necessary for the application.
