ascanrules.desc = Active Scan Rules

ascanrules.bufferoverflow.name = Buffer Overflow
ascanrules.bufferoverflow.desc = Buffer overflow errors are characterized by the overwriting of memory spaces of the background web process, which should have never been modified intentionally or unintentionally. Overwriting values of the IP (Instruction Pointer), BP (Base Pointer) and other registers causes exceptions, segmentation faults, and other process errors to occur. Usually these errors end execution of the application in an unexpected way. 
ascanrules.bufferoverflow.soln = Rewrite the background program using proper return length checking.  This will require a recompile of the background executable.
ascanrules.bufferoverflow.refs = https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/Buffer_overflow_attack
ascanrules.bufferoverflow.other = Potential Buffer Overflow.  The script closed the connection and threw a 500 Internal Server Error

ascanrules.commandinjection.name=Remote OS Command Injection
ascanrules.commandinjection.desc=Attack technique used for unauthorized execution of operating system commands.

ascanrules.formatstring.name=Format String Error
ascanrules.formatstring.desc=A Format String error occurs when the submitted data of an input string is evaluated as a command by the application. 
ascanrules.formatstring.soln= Rewrite the background program using proper deletion of bad character strings.  This will require a recompile of the background executable.
ascanrules.formatstring.refs=https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/Format_string_attack
ascanrules.formatstring.error1 = Potential Format String Error.  The script closed the connection on a /%s
ascanrules.formatstring.error2 = Potential Format String Error.  The script closed the connection on a /%s and /%x
ascanrules.formatstring.error3 = Potential Format String Error.  The script closed the connection on a microsoft format string error

ascanrules.sourcecodedisclosurewebinf.soln = The web server should be configured to not serve the /WEB-INF folder or its contents to web browsers, since it contains sensitive information such as compiled Java source code and properties files which may contain credentials. Java classes deployed with the application should be obfuscated, as an additional layer of defence in a "defence-in-depth" approach.
ascanrules.sourcecodedisclosurewebinf.skipJava9 = not supported on Java 9+
ascanrules.sourcecodedisclosurewebinf.propertiesfile.name = Properties File Disclosure - /WEB-INF folder

This does not eliminate SQL injection, but minimizes its impact.\nGrant the minimum database access that is necessary for the application.
