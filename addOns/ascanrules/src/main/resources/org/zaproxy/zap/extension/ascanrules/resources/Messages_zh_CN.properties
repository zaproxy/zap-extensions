ascanrules.sqlinjection.alert.unionbased.extrainfo = RDBMS [{0}] likely, given UNION-specific error message regular expression [{1}] matched by the HTML results\nThe vulnerability was detected by manipulating the parameter with an SQL ''UNION'' clause to cause a database error message to be returned and recognised

ascanrules.sqlinjection.soln = Do not trust client side input, even if there is client side validation in place.\nIn general, type check all data on the server side.\nIf the application uses JDBC, use PreparedStatement or CallableStatement, with parameters passed by '?'\nIf the application uses ASP, use ADO Command Objects with strong type checking and parameterized queries.\nIf database Stored Procedures can be used, use them.\nDo *not* concatenate strings into queries in the stored procedure, or use 'exec', 'exec immediate', or equivalent functionality\!\nDo not create dynamic SQL queries using simple string concatenation.\nEscape all data received from the client.\nApply an 'allow list' of allowed characters, or a 'deny list' of disallowed characters in user input.\nApply the principle of least privilege by using the least privileged database user possible.\nIn particular, avoid using the 'sa' or 'db-owner' database users. This does not eliminate SQL injection, but minimizes its impact.\nGrant the minimum database access that is necessary for the application.
ascanrules.sqlinjection.sqlite.alert.errorbased.extrainfo = The following known SQLite error message was provoked\: [{0}].
ascanrules.sqlinjection.sqlite.alert.timebased.extrainfo = The query time is controllable using parameter value [{0}], which caused the request to take [{1}] milliseconds, parameter value [{2}], which caused the request to take [{3}] milliseconds, when the original unmodified query with value [{4}] took [{5}] milliseconds.
ascanrules.sqlinjection.sqlite.alert.versionnumber.extrainfo = Using a UNION based SQL Injection attack, and by exploiting SQLite''s dynamic typing mechanism, the SQLite version was determined to be [{0}].\nWith string-based injection points, full SQLite version information can be extracted, but with numeric injection points, only partial SQLite version information can be extracted.\nMore information on SQLite version [{0}] is available at http\://www.sqlite.org/changes.html
ascanrules.sqlinjection.sqlite.name = SQL Injection - SQLite

ascanrules.traceaxd.soln = Consider whether or not Trace Viewer is actually required in production, if it isn't then disable it. If it is then ensure access to it requires authentication and authorization.
