ascanrules.cloudmetadata.name = Cloud Metadata Potentially Exposed
ascanrules.cloudmetadata.desc = The Cloud Metadata Attack attempts to abuse a misconfigured NGINX server in order to access the instance metadata maintained by cloud service providers such as AWS, GCP and Azure.\n\
\n\
All of these providers provide metadata via an internal unroutable IP address '169.254.169.254' - this can be exposed by incorrectly configured NGINX servers and accessed by using this IP address in the Host header field.
ascanrules.cloudmetadata.otherinfo = Based on the successful response status code cloud metadata may have been returned in the response. Check the response data to see if any cloud metadata has been returned.\n\
\n\
The meta data returned can include information that would allow an attacker to completely compromise the system.

ascanrules.getforpost.name=GET for POST
ascanrules.getforpost.desc=A request that was originally observed as a POST was also accepted as a GET. This issue does not represent a security weakness unto itself, however, it may facilitate simplification of other attacks. For example if the original POST is subject to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), then this finding may indicate that a simplified (GET based) XSS may also be possible.

ascanrules.sqlinjection.mssql.soln=Do not trust client side input, even if there is client side validation in place. \n\
In general, type check all data on the server side.\n\
If the application uses JDBC, use PreparedStatement or CallableStatement, with parameters passed by '?'\n\
If the application uses ASP, use ADO Command Objects with strong type checking and parameterized queries.\n\
If database Stored Procedures can be used, use them.\n\
Do *not* concatenate strings into queries in the stored procedure, or use 'exec', 'exec immediate', or equivalent functionality\!\n\
Do not create dynamic SQL queries using simple string concatenation.\n\
Escape all data received from the client.\n\
Apply an 'allow list' of allowed characters, or a 'deny list' of disallowed characters in user input.\n\
Apply the privilege of least privilege by using the least privileged database user possible.\n\
In particular, avoid using the 'sa' or 'db-owner' database users. This does not eliminate SQL injection, but minimizes its impact.\n\
Grant the minimum database access that is necessary for the application.
