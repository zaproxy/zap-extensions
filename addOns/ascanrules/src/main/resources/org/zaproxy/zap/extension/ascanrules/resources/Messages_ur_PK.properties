ascanrules.desc=Active Scan Rules

ascanrules.bufferoverflow.name=Buffer Overflow
ascanrules.bufferoverflow.desc=Buffer overflow errors are characterized by the overwriting of memory spaces of the background web process, which should have never been modified intentionally or unintentionally. Overwriting values of the IP (Instruction Pointer), BP (Base Pointer) and other registers causes exceptions, segmentation faults, and other process errors to occur. Usually these errors end execution of the application in an unexpected way. 
ascanrules.bufferoverflow.soln=Rewrite the background program using proper return length checking.  This will require a recompile of the background executable.
ascanrules.bufferoverflow.refs=https\://www.owasp.org/index.php/Buffer_overflow_attack
ascanrules.bufferoverflow.other=Potential Buffer Overflow.  The script closed the connection and threw a 500 Internal Server Error


ascanrules.commandinjectionplugin.name=Remote OS Command Injection
ascanrules.commandinjectionplugin.desc=Attack technique used for unauthorized execution of operating system commands. This attack is possible when an application accepts untrusted input to build operating system commands in an insecure manner involving improper data sanitization, and/or improper calling of external programs.

ascanrules.formatstring.name=Format String Error
ascanrules.formatstring.desc=A Format String error occurs when the submitted data of an input string is evaluated as a command by the application. 
ascanrules.formatstring.soln=Rewrite the background program using proper deletion of bad character strings.  This will require a recompile of the background executable.
ascanrules.formatstring.refs=https\://www.owasp.org/index.php/Format_string_attack
ascanrules.formatstring.error1=Potential Format String Error.  The script closed the connection on a /%s
ascanrules.formatstring.error2=Potential Format String Error.  The script closed the connection on a /%s and /%x
ascanrules.formatstring.error3=Potential Format String Error.  The script closed the connection on a microsoft format string error

ascanrules.testsqlinjection.name=SQL Injection
ascanrules.testsqlinjection.desc=SQL injection may be possible.
ascanrules.testsqlinjection.soln=Do not trust client side input, even if there is client side validation in place.  \nIn general, type check all data on the server side.\nIf the application uses JDBC, use PreparedStatement or CallableStatement, with parameters passed by '?'\nIf the application uses ASP, use ADO Command Objects with strong type checking and parameterized queries.\nIf database Stored Procedures can be used, use them.\nDo *not* concatenate strings into queries in the stored procedure, or use 'exec', 'exec immediate', or equivalent functionality\!\nDo not create dynamic SQL queries using simple string concatenation.\nEscape all data received from the client.\nApply an 'allow list' of allowed characters, or a 'deny list' of disallowed characters in user input.\nApply the principle of least privilege by using the least privileged database user possible.\nIn particular, avoid using the 'sa' or 'db-owner' database users. This does not eliminate SQL injection, but minimizes its impact.\nGrant the minimum database access that is necessary for the application.
