ascanrules.bufferoverflow.name = Puffer\u00fcberlauf
ascanrules.bufferoverflow.desc = Buffer overflow errors are characterized by the overwriting of memory spaces of the background web process, which should have never been modified intentionally or unintentionally. Overwriting values of the IP (Instruction Pointer), BP (Base Pointer) and other registers causes exceptions, segmentation faults, and other process errors to occur. Usually these errors end execution of the application in an unexpected way.

ascanrules.cloudmetadata.otherinfo = Based on the successful response status code cloud metadata may have been returned in the response. Check the response data to see if any cloud metadata has been returned.\n\
\n\
The meta data returned can include information that would allow an attacker to completely compromise the system.

For example if the original POST is subject to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), then this finding may indicate that a simplified (GET based) XSS may also be possible.
ascanrules.getforpost.soln=Ensure that only POST is accepted where POST is expected.

ascanrules.heartbleed.name=Heartbleed OpenSSL Vulnerability
ascanrules.heartbleed.desc=The TLS implementation in OpenSSL 1.0.1 before 1.0.1g does not properly handle Heartbeat Extension packets, which allows remote attackers to obtain sensitive information from process memory via crafted packets that trigger a buffer over-read, potentially disclosing sensitive information.
