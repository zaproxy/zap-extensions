<h1>Active Scan Rules</h1>
The following release status active scan rules are included in this add-on:

<h2 id="id-40034">.env Information Leak</h2>
Checks for web accessible .env files which may leak sensitive information 
(such as usernames, passwords, API or APP keys, etc.).
Environment files come in many flavors but mostly they are KEY=VALUE formatted. <br>
This rule checks for how servers deliver them by default;
NGINX returns them as binary/octet-stream content-type Apache just returns the text
with no content-type. This rule also check for content length over 500 characters to try and exclude
larger, possibly intentional, files.

<h2 id="id-30001">Buffer Overflow</h2>

Looks for indicators of buffer overflows in compiled code.  It does this by putting out large strings of input text and look for code crash
and abnormal session closure.

Alert ID: <a href="https://www.zaproxy.org/docs/alerts/30001/">30001</a>.

<h2 id="id-90034">Cloud Metadata Attack</h2>
Attempts to abuse a misconfigured NGINX server in order to access the instance metadata maintained by cloud service providers such as AWS, GCP, Azure, and Alibaba.<br>
Most of these services provide metadata via an internal unroutable IP address '169.254.169.254' ('100.100.100.200' for Alibaba) - this can be exposed by incorrectly configured NGINX servers and accessed by using this IP address in the Host header field.

<br>
Alert ID: <a href="https://www.zaproxy.org/docs/alerts/90034/">90034</a>.

<h2 id="id-90019">Code Injection</h2>

This rule submits PHP and ASP attack strings as values for URL parameters in a request and examines the response to 
see if those values have been evaluated by the server. First, requests are constructed and sent containing injected PHP instructions
to print a token. In the event of a match between the token and the content of the response body, the scanner raises an alert and returns immediately.
If there aren't any matches, the scanner will construct requests with several injected ASP strings that instruct the server to write the product
of two randomly generated integers in the response. If the body of the response matches the product, an alert is raised.
<p>

<br>
Alert ID: <a href="https://www.zaproxy.org/docs/alerts/90019/">90019</a>.

<h2 id="id-90020">Command Injection</h2>

This rule submits *NIX and Windows OS commands as URL parameter values to determine whether or not the web application is passing unchecked
user input directly to the underlying OS. The injection strings consist of meta-characters that may be interpreted by the OS
as join commands along with a payload that should generate output in the response if the application is vulnerable. If the content of a response body
matches the payload, the scanner raises an alert and returns immediately. In the event that none of the error-based matching attempts
return output in the response, the scanner will attempt a blind injection attack by submitting sleep instructions as the payload and comparing the elapsed time between sending the request
and receiving the response against a heuristic time-delay lower limit. If the elapsed time is greater than this limit, an alert is raised with medium confidence
and the scanner returns immediately.
<br>
Post 2.5.0 you can change the length of time used for the blind injection attack by changing the <code>rules.common.sleep</code> parameter via the Options 'Rule configuration' panel.

Alert ID: <a href="https://www.zaproxy.org/docs/alerts/90020/">90020</a>.

<h2 id="id-40012">Cross Site Scripting (Reflected)</h2>

This rule starts by submitting a 'safe' value and analyzing all of the locations in which this value occurs in the response (if any). <br>
It then performs a series of attacks specifically targeted at the location in which each of the instances occurs, 
including tag attributes, URL attributes, attributes in tags which support src attributes, html comments etc. <br>
Note: <br>
This rule only scans HTTP PUT requests at LOW threshold.<br>
If the alert threshold is set to LOW, XSS injection located in a JSON response results in a LOW risk and LOW confidence alert is raised.
For other response content-types a LOW confidence alert is raised.<br>
If the alert threshold is set to either MEDIUM or HIGH, XSS injection located in non-HTML responses do not generate alerts.<br>
<p>
If specific characters are stripped out of a reflected payload then the attacks will be repeated with alternative characters that might have the same effect.
<p>

<br>
Alert ID: <a href="https://www.zaproxy.org/docs/alerts/40012/">40012</a>.

<h2 id="id-40014">Cross Site Scripting (persistent)</h2>

This rule starts by submitting a unique 'safe' value and then spiders the whole application to find all of the locations in which the value occurs.<br>
It then performs a series of attacks in the same way that the 'reflected' version does but in this case checks all of the 
target locations in other pages.<br>
Note: <br>
This rule only scans HTTP PUT requests at LOW threshold.<br>
If an XSS injection is located in a JSON response a LOW risk and LOW confidence alert is raised.<br>

<h2 id="id-40003">CRLF Injection</h2>

This rule submits various CRLF special characters preceding an injected "Set-Cookie" header as a parameter to the server. If the response contains an identical Set-Cookie header,
an alert is raised and the scanner returns immediately.
<p>

<h2 id="id-0">Directory Browsing</h2>

This rule checks to see if a request will provide access to a directory listing by examining the response body for patterns used with Apache, IIS
and other web server software.
<p>
Latest code: <a href="https://github.com/zaproxy/zap-extensions/blob/main/addOns/ascanrules/src/main/java/org/zaproxy/zap/extension/ascanrules/DirectoryBrowsingScanRule.java">DirectoryBrowsingScanRule.java</a>
<br>
Alert ID: <a href="https://www.zaproxy.org/docs/alerts/0/">0</a>.

<h2 id="id-40028">ELMAH Information Leak</h2>
Tests to see if the Error Logging Modules and Handlers (elmah.axd) HTTP Module is available. Although this module is handy for
developers and other stakeholders it can also leak a significant amount of information which a security analyst or malicious individual
may be interested in.<br><br>
The ELMAH scan rule targets Microsoft based technologies: IIS, Windows, ASP, and MSSQL.<br>
Files are only reported if they contain the text "Error Log for" unless a LOW alert threshold is set.

<br>
Alert ID: <a href="https://www.zaproxy.org/docs/alerts/40028/">40028</a>.

<h2 id="id-20019">External Redirect</h2>

This rule submits a variety of URL redirect strings as parameter values in a request, then examines the headers and bodies of responses to determine
whether or not a redirect occurred and of what type. The cause of redirect is searched for in the "Location" and "Refresh" header fields, as well as by HTML meta tags
and Javascript in the body of the response. An alert is raised including the redirection type and the scanner returns immediately.

<br>
Alert ID: <a href="https://www.zaproxy.org/docs/alerts/20019/">20019</a>.

<h2 id="id-30002">Format String Error</h2>
Looks for indicators of format string handling errors in compiled code.  It does this by putting out strings of input text based upon characters
compiled C code anticipates to produce formatted output and look for code crash and abnormal session closures.
<p>
Latest code: <a href="https://github.com/zaproxy/zap-extensions/blob/main/addOns/ascanrules/src/main/java/org/zaproxy/zap/extension/ascanrules/FormatStringScanRule.java">FormatStringScanRule.java</a>
<br>
Alert ID: <a href="https://www.zaproxy.org/docs/alerts/30002/">30002</a>.

<h2 id="id-10058">GET for POST</h2>
This scan rule takes <code>application/x-www-form-urlencoded</code> POST requests, changes the parameters from POST to GET and resubmits the request. 
If the GET response is the same as the original POST response then an alert is raised. While this does not necessarily
represent a security weakness unto itself it may indicate that other attacks or weaknesses can be expanded or simplified.
(Such as a POST based Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attack being changed to GET.)
<p>

<br>
Alert ID: <a href="https://www.zaproxy.org/docs/alerts/20015/">20015</a>.

<h2 id="id-40035">Hidden File Finder</h2>
This scan rule checks for various web accessible files which may leak administrative, configuration, or credential information.
The original included set of payloads were based on <a href="https://github.com/hannob/snallygaster">Snallygaster</a> by Hanno Böck.
Such payloads are verified by checking response code, and content. If the response code is 200 (Ok) then additional content checks are performed to increase alert confidence.
If the response code is 401 (Unauthorized) or 403 (Forbidden) or the content checks are un-successful then an alert is raised with lower confidence (at LOW Threshold).
<strong>Note:</strong> If the Custom Payloads addon is installed you can add your own hidden file paths (payloads) in the Custom Payloads options panel. 
For custom payloads only the response status code is checked. If there is a requirement to include a content check then it is also possible to add payloads to 
the <code>json/hidden_files.json</code> file in ZAP's user directory (in which case they will be treated as included payloads).
<p>
The following describes the fields of the JSON entries.
<pre><code>
{
  "path":"some/path/without/leading/slash.ext",
  "content":["content you want to find in responses"],
  "not_content":["content you do not want the response to have"],
  "binary":"\\x01\\x00",
  "links":["https://example.com/relevant/reference.html,"https://other.example.org/"],
  "type":"short_identifier",
  "source":"attribution_not_used_by_output_or_checks"
}
</code></pre>
<p>
Details worth noting:
<ul>
  <li>The only field that is required is path.</li>
  <li>The fields content, not_content, and links can have multiple quoted, comma separated values (arrays of strings).</li>
  <li>Checks of binary content are based on starting position 0 (ex: startsWith not contains).</li>
</ul>
<p>
The following is an example JSON entry:
<pre><code>
{
  "path":"CVS/root",
  "content":[":"],
  "not_content":["<"],
  "type":"cvs_dir",
  "source":"snallygaster"
}
</code></pre>

<h2 id="id-90024">Padding Oracle</h2>
This rule attempts to manipulate the padding of encrypted strings to trigger an error response 
indicating a likely padding oracle vulnerability. 
Such a vulnerability can affect any application or framework that uses encryption improperly, such as 
some versions of ASP.net, Java Server Faces, and Mono.

<br>
Alert ID: <a href="https://www.zaproxy.org/docs/alerts/90024/">90024</a>.

<h2 id="id-40008">Parameter Tampering</h2>

This rule submits requests with parameter values known to cause errors to be displayed to the user if handled improperly. Responses are checked to make sure that they return
a server error status code, then compared with a normal HTTP response to make sure it does not raise an alert if the bad parameter has no effect on output. Finally, the content
of the response body is compared against various patterns that may be found in Java servlet, Microsoft VBScript, OLE DB, JET, PHP and Tomcat errors. If a match is found, an alert is raised and
the scanner returns immediately.
<p>

<br>
Alert ID: <a href="https://www.zaproxy.org/docs/alerts/40008/">40008</a>.

<h2 id="id-6">Path Traversal</h2>

This rule attempts to access files and directories outside of the web document root by constructing various combinations of pathname prefixes
and local file targets for Windows and *NIX systems as well as Java servlets. If the body of the response matches a pattern corresponding to the
current target file an alert is raised and the scanner returns immediately. If none of the common local file targets succeed, path traversal is 
attempted using the filename in the URL. As long as submitting an arbitrary filename does not return an OK status code but the real filename does, an alert is raised
and the scanner returns immediately.
<p>
Note: This scan rule has one check that is excluded at High Alert Threshold.

<h2 id="id-7">Remote File Include</h2>

This rule submits a series of requests with external URLs as parameter values and looks for a match between the response body and the title of the page
hosted at those URLs. If there is a match between the expected string and the response body, and the header returned a status code of 200, an alert is raised and the scanner
returns immediately.
<p>

<h2 id="id-40018">SQL Injection</h2>

This scanner scans for SQL Injection vulnerabilities in an RDBMS-independent fashion, 
by attacking url parameters and form parameters with fragments of valid and invalid SQL syntax, using error based, 
boolean based, Union based, and stacked query SQL Injection techniques. <br>
This scanner may be able to fingerprint the RDBMS if the application throws a known RDBMS specific SQL error message. <br>
This scanner does not exploit any RDBMS specific techniques, and so is the best SQL injection scanner to use as a starting point.

Alert ID: <a href="https://www.zaproxy.org/docs/alerts/40018/">40018</a>.

<h2 id="id-40020">SQL Injection - Hypersonic (Time Based)</h2>

This rule uses Hypersonic-specific SQL syntax to attempt to induce time delays in the SQL statement called by the page.<br> 
If the unmodified query is not affected by a time delay, and the modified query's delay can be controlled, 
it is indicative of a time-based SQL Injection vulnerability in a Hypersonic SQL database. <br>
This rule is time sensitive, and should only be used in an attempt to find stubborn and un-obvious SQL 
injection vulnerabilities in a suspected Hypersonic database. <br>
For this reason, the number of active scan threads should be set to the minimum when using this scan rule, 
to minimise load on the web server, application server, and database, in order to avoid false positives caused by 
load delays rather than by SQL injection delays. <br>
The rule tests only for time-based SQL injection vulnerabilities.<br>
<br>
Post 2.5.0 you can change the length of time used for the attack by changing the <code>rules.common.sleep</code> parameter via the Options 'Rule configuration' panel.

<h2 id="id-40019">SQL Injection - MySQL (Time Based)</h2>

This rule uses MySQL-specific SQL syntax to attempt to induce time delays in the SQL statement called by the page.<br> 
If the unmodified query is not affected by a time delay, and the modified query's delay can be controlled, 
it is indicative of a time-based SQL Injection vulnerability in a MySQL database. <br>
This rule is time sensitive, and should only be used in an attempt to find stubborn and un-obvious SQL 
injection vulnerabilities in a suspected MySQL database. <br>
For this reason, the number of active scan threads should be set to the minimum when using this scan rule, 
to minimise load on the web server, application server, and database, in order to avoid false positives caused by 
load delays rather than by SQL injection delays. <br>
The rule tests only for time-based SQL injection vulnerabilities.<br>
<br>
Post 2.5.0 you can change the length of time used for the attack by changing the <code>rules.common.sleep</code> parameter via the Options 'Rule configuration' panel.

<h2 id="id-40021">SQL Injection - Oracle (Time Based)</h2>

This scan rule uses Oracle-specific SQL syntax to attempt to induce time delays in the SQL statement called by the page.<br> 
If the unmodified query is not affected by a time delay, and the modified query's delay can be controlled, 
it is indicative of a time-based SQL Injection vulnerability in a Oracle SQL database. <br>

load delays rather than by SQL injection delays. <br>
The scan rule tests only for time-based SQL injection vulnerabilities.<br>
<br>
Note that this rule does not currently allow you to change the length of time used for the timing attacks due to the way the delay is caused.

<h2 id="id-40024">SQL Injection - SQLite</h2>
This active scan rule attempts to inject SQLite specific commands into parameter values and analyzes the server's responses to see if the commands were effectively executed on the server (indicating a successful SQL injection attack).

<h2 id="id-40029">Trace.axd Information Leak</h2>
Tests to see if Trace Viewer (trace.axd) is available. Although this component is convenient for developers and 
other stakeholders it can leak a significant amount of information which a security analyst or malicious individual
may be interested in.<br><br>
The trace.axd scan rule targets Microsoft based technologies: IIS, Windows, ASP, and MSSQL.

<h2 id="id-10104">User Agent Fuzzer</h2>
This active scan rule checks for differences in response based on fuzzed User Agent (eg. mobile sites, access as a Search Engine Crawler). The rule compares the response statuscode and the hashcode of the response body with the original response.<br>
<strong>Note:</strong> If the Custom Payloads addon is installed you can add your own User Agent strings (payloads) in the Custom Payloads options panel.

<h2 id="id-90021">XPath Injection</h2>
As described by OWASP: "XPath Injection attacks occur when a web site uses user-supplied information to 
construct an XPath query for XML data. By sending intentionally malformed information into the web site, 
an attacker can find out how the XML data is structured, or access data that he may not normally have access 
to. He may even be able to elevate his privileges on the web site if the XML data is being used for 
authentication (such as an XML based user file) or authorization." This rule attempts to identify such 
weaknesses.

<h2 id="id-90017">XSLT Injection</h2>
This scan rule checks for certain responses induced by injecting XSL transformations. <br/>
It attempts to obtain those responses with payloads which may induce: error responses, disclosure of library/framework vendor name, remote port scanning, or command execution.

<h2 id="id-90023">XXE</h2>
This component attempts to identify applications which are subject to XML eXternal Entity (XXE) attacks.
Applications which parse XML input may be subject to XXE when weakly or poorly configured parsers 
handle XML input containing reference to an external entity such as a local file, HTTP requests to 
internal or tertiary systems, etc. The number of tags which are tested individually depends on the strength of the rule.<br>
<br>
This scan rule will only run if the OAST add-on is installed and available.
It is also recommended that you test that the Callbacks service in the OAST add-on is correctly configured for your target site.
If the target system cannot connect to the Callback Address then some XXE vulnerabilities will not be detected.
