<H1>DOM XSS Active Scan Rule</H1>
<p>
An Active Scan rule for detecting DOM XSS vulnerabilities.
<p>
It launches browser windows and sends attack payloads to all of the relevant DOM elements.<br>
As it launches browser windows it will take significantly longer than other (non browser based) rules. 
</p>
<p>
This version supports Firefox (the default) and Chrome. They can be run with GUI or headless (default), it can be changed with
the rule <code>rules.domxss.browserid</code>, via the Options 'Rule configuration' panel, with values
<code>firefox</code>, <code>firefox-headless</code>, <code>chrome</code> and <code>chrome-headless</code>.
</p>
<p>
The following Attack Strengths are supported, and related directly to the number of attack payloads used
for URL fragment and form input field injections (eg: http://example.com/index.html?foo=bar#injection):
<ul>
<li>LOW: 1 attack payloads 
<li>MEDIUM: 3 attack payloads 
<li>HIGH: 6 attack payloads 
<li>INSANE: 9 attack payloads 
</ul>
The scanner will also attempt URL/query parameter injections which are not impacted by the selected strength.
</p>
<p>
The rule will only report one DOM XSS vulnerability per node, unless the LOW Alert threshold
is used, in which case it will keep trying all of the specified payloads.
