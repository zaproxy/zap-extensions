<p>
This Options screen allows you to configure Global <a href="alertFilter.html">Alert Filters</a> which allow you to 
automatically override the risk levels of any alerts raised by the active and passive scan rules.
Unlike <a href="contextAlertFilter.html">Context Alert Filters</a> they apply to all alerts raised, 
not just those raised in a specific context.<br>
They will also be persisted across ZAP sessions.
</p>
<p>
The screen shows a list of all of the Global Alert Filters along with buttons for 
adding, removing, and deleting them.
</p>
<p>
Adding or modifying an Alert Filter will display the <a href="alertFilterDialog.html">Alert Filter Dialog</a>.
