<p>
Context <a href="alertFilter.html">Alert Filters</a> allow you to automatically override the risk levels
of any alerts raised by the active and passive scan rules within a context.
The Alert Filters will be exported and imported with the context - 
they will not persist over ZAP sessions unless the context is imported again.
</p>
<p>
This add-on adds an 'Alert Filters' panel to the contexts dialog.<br>
The panel shows a list of all of the Alert Filters along with buttons for 
adding, removing, and deleting them.
</p>
Adding or modifying an Alert Filter will display the <a href="alertFilterDialog.html">Alert Filter Dialog</a>.
