<h1>Context Alert Filters</h1>
<p>
Context Alert Filters allow you to automatically override the risk levels
of any alerts raised by the active and passive scan rules within a context.
</p>
<p>
This add-on adds an 'Alert Filters' panel to the contexts dialog.<br>
The panel shows a list of all of the Alert filters along with buttons for 
adding, removing, and deleting them.
</p>
<p>
To use this add-on you will need to:
<ul>
<li>Add your application to a context</li>
<li>Open the Session Properties dialog (eg by double clicking on the context)</li>
<li>Select the contexts' 'Alert filters' panel</li>
<li>Click 'Add' and fill in the details for each alert you want to override</li>
</ul>
Note: The alert filters will only be applied to new alerts, not to any alerts that were
already present when the filter was created. 
</p>
<p>
The 'add' and 'modify' dialogs have the following fields: 

<h3>Alert</h3>
A pull down containing all of the active and passive alert rules currently installed.

<h3>New Risk Level</h3>
The new risk level to be assigned to any alerts raised that match the criteria defined by the rule.
 
<h3>URL</h3>
An optional URL.<br>
If specified then this rule will be applied if the URL matches the URL of a raised alert.<br>

<h3>URL is Regex?</h3>
If set and a URL is specified then the URL will be treated as a regex expression when compared with the URL of the alert.<br>
If it is not set then any specified URL must exactly match the URL of the alert.

<h3>Parameter</h3>
An optional parameter.<br>
If specified then this rule will be applied if the parameter exactly matches the parameter of a raised alert.<br>

<h3>Enabled</h3>
If set then this rule will be applied to all alerts raise against the given context.
