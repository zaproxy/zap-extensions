<h1>Alert Filters</h1>
<p>
Alert Filters allow you to automatically override the risk levels
of any alerts raised by the active and passive scan.
<p>
There are 2 different types of Alert Filter:

<ul>
<li><a href="contextAlertFilter.html">Context Alert Filters</a></li>
<li><a href="globalAlertFilter.html">Global Alert Filters</a></li>
</ul>

Alert Filters can also be defined in the <a href="automation.html">Automation Framework</a>.

</p>
<p>
The easiest way to create Alert Filters is to right click an alert and select 
the 'Create Alert Filter...' option. This will display the 
<a href="alertFilterDialog.html">Alert Filter Dialog</a>.<br>
You can also create Alert Filter manually.
</p>
By default Alert Filters only apply to new alerts, 
but you can both test and apply the Alert Filters to existing alerts.
