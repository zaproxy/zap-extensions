This screen allows you to configure Global Alert Filters which allow you to 
automatically override the risk levels of any alerts raised by the active and passive scan rules.
Unlike <a href="alertFilter.html">Context Alert Filters</a> they apply to all alerts raised, 
not just those raised in a specific context.
