<BODY>
	<H1>Manual Request Editor dialog</H1>

	This dialog allows you to create a HTTP request from scratch which will
	be submitted to the specified target, or resend an existing HTTP
	request after making any changes to it that you want to.

	<H2>Request tab</H2>

	This shows the request header and data, either in one or two panels
	depending on the options chosen.
	<br />
	<br /> A 'Method' pull down allows you to switch between the HTTP
	methods.
	<br> Note that when the method is changed to a POST then any URL
	parameters are moved into the body, and when the method is changed from
	a POST then any parameters in the body are moved to the URL.
	<br />
	<br /> Pull downs allow you to select different Views for the Request
	header and body.

	<H3>
		<img src="images/view-split.png" width="16" height="16" alt="" />&nbsp;
		Split display for header and body
	</H3>
	This changes the display so that separate panes are used for the header
	and body.
	<br>

	<H3>
		<img src="images/view-all.png" width="16" height="16" alt="" />&nbsp;
		Combined display for header and body
	</H3>
	This changes the display so that the header and body are shown in one
	pane.
	<br>

	<H3>
		<img src="images/fugue/globe-green.png" width="16" height="16" alt="" />&nbsp;
		Use current tracking session
	</H3>
	See the 'Use Global HTTP State' option in Options > Network >
	Connection options screen.
	<br>

	<H3>
		<img src="images/fugue/cookie.png" width="16" height="16" alt="" />&nbsp;
		Accept cookies
	</H3>
	This option controls whether encountered cookies should be added to
	subsequent requests. For example if a request is sent that results in a
	response with Set-Cookie header(s) should those cookies values be added
	to subsequent send attempts from the Manual Request dialog?
	<br>

	<H3>
		<img src="images/follow-redirect.png" width="16" height="16" alt="" />&nbsp;
		Follow redirect
	</H3>
	If selected automatically follows any redirects sent to the browser.
	<br>

	<H3>
		<img src="images/fugue/application-resize.png" width="16" height="16"
			alt="" />&nbsp; Update Content Length
	</H3>
	By default ZAP will automatically update (or add) the Content-Length
	header to match the size of the data submitted. If this option is
	unselected then ZAP will not update the header allowing you to specify
	any value you like.
	<br>

	<H3>
		<img src="images/fugue/server.png" width="16" height="16" alt="" />&nbsp;
		Update Host Header
	</H3>
	By default ZAP will automatically update (or add) the Host header to
	match the URL specified. If this option is unselected then ZAP will not
	update the header allowing you to specify any value you like.
	<br>

	<H3>
		<img src="images/csrf-button.png" width="16" height="16" alt="" />&nbsp;
		Regenerate Anti-CSRF Token
	</H3>
	If selected automatically regenerates Anti-CSRF tokens if any exist.
	Currently only supported in the message body and requires that the
	Anti-CSRF extension is enabled.
	<br>

	<H3>
		<img src="images/lowercase-header-button.png" width="16" height="16"
			alt="" />&nbsp; Lowercase Header Names
	</H3>
	This will lowercase all the header names, making them compliant with
	HTTP/2.
	<br>

	<H3>
		<img src="images/layout-tabbed.png" width="16" height="16" alt="" />&nbsp;
		Request and Response tabs side by side
	</H3>
	This changes the display so that the request and response tabs are side
	by side.
	<br> This increases the information that can be displayed but
	means you cannot see both the request and response at the same time.

	<H3>
		<img src="images/layout-vertical-split.png" width="16" height="16"
			alt="" />&nbsp; Request shown above Response
	</H3>
	This changes the display so that the request panel is shown above the
	response panel.
	<br> This decreases the information that can be displayed but
	means you can see both the request and response at the same time.

	<H3>
		<img src="images/layout-horizontal-split.png" width="16" height="16"
			alt="" />&nbsp; Request and Response panels side by side
	</H3>
	This changes the display so that the request panel is shown to the left
	of the response panel.
	<br> This decreases the information that can be displayed but
	means you can see both the request and response at the same time.

	<H2>Response tab</H2>

	This shows the data sent to your browser in response to the request
	that you submitted, either in one or two panels depending on the
	options chosen.
	<br />
	<br /> Pull downs allow you to select different Views for the Response
	header and body.
