<H1>QA Standard Policy</H1>

A quality assurance focused policy meant to perform fairly quickly while providing a greater set of results than developer policies, 
intended for use in a QA/staging environment.

<ul>
    <li>Intended to run in a QA / Staging environment which is close to production</li>
    <li>A superset of Developer Standard but with important env / server rules enabled</li>
    <li>Not env issues that should have been fixed by everyone</li>
</ul>
<p>
For the list of scan rules included see the <a href="https://www.zaproxy.org/alerttags/policy_qa_std/">Alert Tag: POLICY_QA_STD</a> page.
