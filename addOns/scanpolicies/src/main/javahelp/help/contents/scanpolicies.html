<H1>Scan Policies</H1>
This add-on provides a set of Scan Policies tuned for different purposes.
<p>
These policies are initialised as detailed in the relevant pages, but you can tune them as required.

<ul>
    <li><a href="policy-default.html">Default Policy</a> : the default policy, all installed active rules enabled
    <li><a href="policy-dev-cicd.html">Developer CICD Policy</a> : a policy intended for CI/CD use, focused on quick but higher risk issues
    <li><a href="policy-dev-std.html">Developer Standard Policy</a> : a policy directed at developers, meant to perform fairly quickly while providing a greater set of results than the CICD policy (intended for use in a dev environment)
    <li><a href="policy-dev-full.html">Developer Full Policy</a> : a developer focused policy, including a superset of the dev standard with a greater variety of potential findings and only minimal environmental/server related rules (intended for use in a dev environment)
    <li><a href="policy-qa-std.html">QA Standard Policy</a> : a quality assurance focused policy meant to perform fairly quickly while providing a greater set of results than developer policies, intended for use in a QA/staging environment
    <li><a href="policy-qa-full.html">QA Full Policy</a> : a more comprehensive quality assurance focused policy, including a superset of the QA standard with a greater variety of potential findings with more environmental/server related rules, intended for use in a QA/Staging environment
    <li><a href="policy-api.html">API Policy</a> : a policy focusing on issues likely to impact APIs and not UI.
</ul>
