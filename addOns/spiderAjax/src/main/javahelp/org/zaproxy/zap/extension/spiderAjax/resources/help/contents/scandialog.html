<H1>AJAX Spider dialog</H1>

This dialog launches the AJAX Spider. 

<h2>Scope</h2>
The first tab allows you to change key features like:

<h3>Starting Point</h3>

The URL which the AJAX spider will start crawling from, or a context (in which case it
will be used one of the URLs that are in context as starting point).

<h3>Context</h3>
Allows to select the Context to be spidered.

<h3>User</h3>
Allows to select one of the users available from the selected context, to perform the spider scan as a user (ZAP will (re)authenticate as that user whenever necessary).

<h3>Just In Scope</h3>

If set then any URLs which are out of scope will be ignored.
<p>
<strong>Note:</strong> The option <code>Just In Scope</code> is mutually exclusive with <code>Context</code> option, if one is used the other is ignored.

<h3>Spider Subtree Only</h3>
If set then the spider will only access resources that are under the starting point (URI).
When evaluating if a resource is found within the specified subtree, the spider considers only the scheme, host, port, and path components of the URI.

<h3>Browser</h3>

The type of browser to use.<br>
Browsers will only be shown if ZAP has sufficient configuration to run them.<br>
They may still fail to run if the browsers cannot be found or if the configuration information is incorrect.

<h3>Show Advanced Options</h3>

If selected then the Options tab will be shown.

<h2>Options</h2>
This tab allows you to change options including:

<h3>Number of Browser Windows to Open</h3>
You can configure the number of windows to be used by AJAX Spider.<br>
The more windows, the faster the process will be.

<h3>Maximum Crawl Depth</h3>
The maximum depth that the crawler can reach. Zero means unlimited depth.

<h3>Maximum Crawl States</h3>
The maximum number of states that the crawler should crawl. Zero means unlimited crawl states. 

<h3>Maximum Duration</h3>
The maximum time that the crawler is allowed to run. Zero means unlimited running time.

<h3>Event Wait Time</h3>
The time to wait after a client side event is fired.

<h3>Reload Wait Time</h3>
The time to wait after URL is loaded.

<h3>Allowed Resources</h3>
The list of allowed resources. The allowed resources are always fetched even if out of scope, allowing to include necessary resources (e.g. scripts) from 3rd-parties.
