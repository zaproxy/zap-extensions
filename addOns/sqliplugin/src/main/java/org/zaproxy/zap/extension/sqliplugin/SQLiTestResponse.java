       How to identify if the injected payload succeeded.

       Sub-tag: <comparison>
           Perform a request with this string as the payload and compare
           the response with the <payload> response. Apply the comparison
           algorithm.

           NOTE: useful to test for boolean-based blind SQL injections.

       Sub-tag: <grep>
           Regular expression to grep for in the response body.

           NOTE: useful to test for error-based SQL injection.

       Sub-tag: <time>
           Time in seconds to wait before the response is returned.

           NOTE: useful to test for time-based blind and stacked queries
           SQL injections.

       Sub-tag: <union>
           Calls unionTest() function.

           NOTE: useful to test for UNION query (inband) SQL injection.
