<H1>CSP Helper</H1>
This add-on generates a Content Security Policy (CSP) Header for sites and allows you to test it without making any changes to the site.
<p>
In order to use it:
<ol>
<li>Add the site you want to generate CSP for to ZAP, for example by proxying your browser through ZAP or by using one of the ZAP Spiders</li>
<li>Locate the site in the Sites tree, right click it and select 'Enable for CSP Helper'</li> 
<li>Explore the site as thoroughly as possible</li>
</ol>
When you enable the CSP Helper for a site ZAP will generate and inject a CSP header into the HTML returned to your browser.<br>
It will update the CSP header to permit the minimum set of functionality that will let your site continue to function correctly.<br>
It also injects a CSP violation report URL which will cause any CSP violations to be sent to ZAP. 
If you use this add-on with a release after 2.5.0 (which includes the weekly releases) then ZAP will be able to analyse these reports.
A restriction in ZAP releases up to and including 2.5.0 prevents this from working.  
It updates the CSP header based on:
<ul>
<li>Parsing each of the requests from the site</li>
<li>Analysing requests to other sites that include a Referer header from the target site</li>
<li>Analysing any CSP reports generated (post 2.5.0)</li>
</ul
