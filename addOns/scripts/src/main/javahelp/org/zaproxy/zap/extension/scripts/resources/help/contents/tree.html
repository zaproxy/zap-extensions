<H1>Scripts tree tab</H1>
<p>
The Scripts tree tab shows you all of the scripts you currently have loaded organized by type.<br/>
It also shows you which templates you have available - these cannot be run directly, you use them to create new scripts.<br/>
It also allows you to add new scripts, load, save and remove them.<br/>
The tab includes a toolbar which allows you to:
<ul>
<li>Load a script from filestore</li>
<li>Save a script to filestore</li>
<li>Create a new script</li>
</ul>
Scripts that are run within ZAP components, such as the Active Scanner, can be enabled and disabled via right click menu option.<br/>
All scripts can be removed from the UI via a right click 'Remove Script' menu option.
