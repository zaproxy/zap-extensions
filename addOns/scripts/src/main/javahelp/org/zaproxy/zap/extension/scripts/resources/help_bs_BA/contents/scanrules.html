<h1>Script Scan Rules</h1>

Active and Passive Scripts that implement the `getMetadata` function are treated as first-class scan rules by ZAP.

Example implementation of this function in a script would look like:

<pre><code>
function getMetadata() {
	return ScanRuleMetadata.fromYaml(`
id: 12345
name: Active Vulnerability Title
description: Full description
solution: The solution
references:
  - Reference 1
  - Reference 2
category: INJECTION  # info_gather, browser, server, misc, injection
risk: INFO  # info, low, medium, high
confidence: LOW  # false_positive, low, medium, high, user_confirmed
cweId: 0
wascId: 0
alertTags:
  name1: value1
  name2: value2
otherInfo: Any other Info
status: alpha
`);
}
</code></pre>

The <code>category</code> field is only used for Active Scan Scripts.

Any additional fields in the metadata are ignored.

The metadata function is evaluated upon saving the script, which is exposed as a scan rule if the metadata is valid.
