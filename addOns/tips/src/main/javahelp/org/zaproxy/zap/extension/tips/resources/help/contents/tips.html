<!-- Note that this file is generated by ExtensionTipsAndTricks-->
This add-on adds a 'help' menu item which displays useful ZAP tips and tricks.<br>
Tips are also shown in the splash screen on start up.
<H2>Full list of tips</H2>

<p>Add your target application to a Context using the 'right click' menu: 'Include in Context'.<br>
This allows you tell ZAP more about the target, such as the authentication, the users and the technology it uses. </p>


<p>Click on the 'gear' icon on the right hand side of many tabs to quickly access the setting for that feature.  </p>


<p>Docker Support - https://github.com/zaproxy/zaproxy/wiki/Docker </p>


<p>Does your application use anti CSRF tokens?<br>
Make sure you have configured ZAP to handle them via the 'Options / Active Scan' screen. </p>


<p>If you are getting too many false positives try changing the threshold for that scan rule to High.<br>
But also report the problem to us via the ZAP Users Group or Issues so we can investigate it - both of which are linked off the 'Online' menu </p>


<p>Install the Retire add-on from the ZAP Marketplace to detect insecure versions of JavaScript libraries using the database from Retire.js. </p>


<p>Install the SAML Add-on from the ZAP Marketplace to detect, show, edit and fuzz SAML requests. </p>


<p>Install the accessControl add-on from the ZAP Marketplace to automate testing of your application's access control. </p>


<p>Install the beta active and passive scan rules to find more potential issues.<br>
There are also alpha active and passive scan rules but obviously they may be less stable. </p>


<p>Install the sequence add-on from the ZAP Marketplace to scan pages that must be visited in a specific order for the full functionality to be accessible. </p>


<p>Manual browse indicator - Pages found by the spiders and forced browser are flagged in the Sites tree with the relevant icon. This icon disappears when you visit that page manually.  </p>


<p>New to ZAP?<br>
Download the 'Getting Started with ZAP' guide from the ZAP Marketplace.  </p>


<p>POST requests have a 'right click' menu for generating an anti CSRF test form </p>


<p>Right click everywhere.<br>
Highlight text and right click it.<br>
A lot of ZAP functionality is context sensitive as best accessed this way. </p>


<p>Save your ZAP session at the start of a test rather than at the end - the session is stored in a db which will be updated all of the time so you wont have to save it again. </p>


<p>The 'Show / enable' fields 'lightbulb' button on the main toolbar will make hidden fields visible and allow you to edit disabled fields. </p>


<p>The Search tab allows you to find string in Fuzz results - it supports regex expressions and inverse matching. </p>


<p>The majority of ZAP's tabs are now hidden by default so that the UI is less cluttered.<br>
You can show and hide all of the tabs via buttons on the main toolbar.<br>
You can also 'pin' any tab you like so that it stays visible even after a restart. </p>


<p>There are a large number of fuzzing files available in the ZAP Marketplace in the 'Directory List *', 'Fuzzdb files' and 'SVN Digger files' add-ons. </p>


<p>There are lots of resources linked off the 'Online' menu, including the ZAP Homepage, User and Developer groups </p>


<p>There is a repository of ZAP scripts at https://github.com/zaproxy/community-scripts<br>
If you clone a local copy then you can add all of them to ZAP via the Scripts Option pane.<br>
You can also upload your own scripts via pull requests - the more the better!  </p>


<p>Try different UI layouts via the buttons on the main toolbar. </p>


<p>Use keyboard shortcuts to speed up your testing - you can define your own combinations via 'Options / Keyboard' which also generates printable shortcut cheatsheets. </p>


<p>Want to chat to someone about ZAP?<br>
Many of the ZAP core developers hang out on the freenode #zaproxy irc channel: https://webchat.freenode.net/#zaproxy </p>


<p>Want to script ZAP in a scripting language other than Java Script and Zest?<br>
Check the ZAP Marketplace for other languages like python and ruby.<br>
If your preferred scripting language isnt yet available then get in touch - its fairly easy to add support for other languages. </p>


<p>You can change the syntax highlighting used for the Request, Response and Script Console tabs via the 'right click' 'Syntax' menus. </p>


<p>You can compare 2 requests or responses by selecting them both, 'right clicking' and selecting one of the 'Compare 2..' menu items. </p>


<p>You can export all of the URLs recorded by ZAP using the top level menu: "Report / Export All URLs to a File..." </p>


<p>You can import URLs contained in a text file using the importurls add-on available on the ZAP Marketplace </p>


<p>You can invoke 3rd party tools like sqlmap and nmap from within ZAP, passing across a wide range of contextual information.<br>
Just configure the applications you want to invoke in the "Options / Applications" screen.  </p>


<p>You can reorder table columns by dragging and dropping them.<br>
You can also select which columns are show via the icon just above the scroll bar on the right hand side of each table. </p>


<p>You can search for text in any text area, including the Request and Response tabs, using the 'right click' 'Find...' menu.   </p>


<p>You can tell ZAP to access an app using a specified user.<br>
To do that you need to add your app to a Context and then define the authentication and user details. </p>


<p>You can tell ZAP to load all of the scripts in a set of directories via the Scripts Option page.<br>
See the help for details of the directory structure. </p>


<p>ZAP can automatically check for updates - turn it on via the 'Options / Check for Updates' screen.<br>
If you dont want it to happen automatically then make sure you manually check for updates frequently via the 'Manage Add-ons' main toolbar button as we continually add new features and fix issues. </p>


<p>ZAP can display, intercept and even fuzz client side messages including postMessages - 'right click' a subtree in the Sites tree and select a suitable submenu under 'Monitor clients'.<br>
Force a browser refresh and your open pages will be displayed in the 'Clients' tab along with all of the client side messages they generate. </p>


<p>ZAP has comprehensive help pages accessible via the 'Help / OWASP ZAP User Guide' menu.<br>
The F1 key will also bring up the help pages and take you straight to the relevant section for the selected tab. </p>


<p>Zest scripts are a great way to automate tasks.<br>
Zest is ZAP's graphical macro language, but provides programming features like conditionals and loops.<br>
Use the 'Record a new Zest script...' button on the main toolbar to quickly record a new Zest script.<br>
You can also 'right click' requests to add them to Zest scripts. </p>
