# The actual tips and tricks - anything with a key stating 'tips.tip.' will be treated as a tip
# General tips
tips.tip.gen.001=Save your ZAP session at the start of a test rather than at the end - the session is stored in a db which will be updated all of the time so you wont have to save it again.
tips.tip.gen.002=Try different UI layouts via the buttons on the main toolbar.
tips.tip.gen.003=Right click everywhere.\n\nHighlight text and right click it.\n\nA lot of ZAP functionality is context sensitive as best accessed this way.
