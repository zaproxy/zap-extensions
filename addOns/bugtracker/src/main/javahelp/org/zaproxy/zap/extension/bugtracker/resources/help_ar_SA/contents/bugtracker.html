<h1>Bug Tracker</h1>
<p>
The Bug Tracker add-on can help the user raise the Alerts that they receive in the form of an issue or a bug on a Bug Tracker (like Bugzilla, Github,etc.) while scanning a web-app.</p>

<h2>Configuration of Bug Trackers</h2>
<p>
The user may configure the Bug Trackers with their important details like Username, Password, Repository URL, etc. by going to <b>Options->Bug Tracker</b> and then selecting the appropriate Bug Tracker.
</p>

<h2>Raising the Issues</h2>
<p>
The user can select one or more Alerts (even their subnodes as per need) after scanning then the user can choose <b>Context Menu Item -> Raise Issue on a Bug Tracker.</b><br>
A new dialog will popup which will give the user the ability to edit the fields or even choose some fields from the existing configuration. For example: If the configuration of Github is chosen then there is no need to fill the Username, Password, and Repository URL as long as they are correct. There is a dropdown called "Choose a Bug Tracker" which the user can choose the Bug Tracker to raise the issue on.<br>

The fields for raising the issue depend on the Bug Tracker and their implementations. <br>

After filling out the fields the user can click "Save" to raise the issue. A message will then be displayed to the user stating if his/her attempt to raise the issue was succesful or not, and if not the reason for that.</p>
