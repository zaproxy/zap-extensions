	<H1>Creating Reports</H1>

	You can easily create your own reports.
	<p>
		The add-on uses the <a href="https://www.thymeleaf.org/">Thymeleaf</a>
		templating engine, so see their documentation for details of the
		templating syntax.
	</p>
	<p>
		The built in reports are copied into the 'reports' directory
		underneath the ZAP <a
			href="https://www.zaproxy.org/faq/what-is-the-default-directory-that-zap-uses/">default
			directory</a>. Each report is in its own subdirectory. The easiest way to
		create a new report is to copy and existing one into a new directory
		at the same level.
	</p>
	<p>Each report subdirectory must include:</p>
	<H3>template.yaml</H3>
	A file containing:
	<pre>
name:        # The display name for the report
format:      # The format, eg one of HTML, XML, MD, JSON, PDF - this is used internally but not currently exposed in ZAP
mode:        # The Thymeleaf template mode, one of HTML, RAW, TEXT, HTML
extension:   # The extension to use when generating the report
sections:    # An optional list of sections - parts of the report which may be included or excluded
themes:      # An optional list of themes - different colours and styles which apply to the same content
</pre>

	<H3>
		report.<i>ext</i>
	</H3>
	The Thymeleaf report template.
	<br> This should have the same extension that is specified in the
	template.yaml file (e.g. 'report.md') except if it is a PDF report, in
	which case "html" should be used (see below).

	<H3>Messages.properties</H3>
	The report subdirectory may also include a "Messages.properties"
	language file for template specific strings localised to English as
	well as "Message_
	<i>locale</i>.property" files for localising the strings into other
	languages.
	<br> The template specific strings should all start with '
	<code>report.template.</code>
	'
	<br> If the report included sections then they must be defined in
	this file - the keys will automatically be prefixed by
	<code>report.template.section.</code>
	. Section names in the template.yaml file must just be alphanumeric
	strings and not start with an integer.
	<br>If a report includes themes then they must be defined in this
	file - the keys will automatically be prefixed by
	<code>report.template.theme.</code>
	. Theme names in the template.yaml file must just be alphanumeric
	strings and not start with an integer.
	<br> The language files may also override the default translations
	built into the reports add-on.

	<H3>Resources</H3>
	The report subdirectory may also include a "resources" directory. If
	this is present then when a report is generated a subdirectory will be
	created based on the report name and all of the files in the resources
	directory will be copied into it.
	<br> You should reference the files in the "resources"
	subdirectory in the following way so that they can be accessed both via
	the template and by the report when the subdirectory is created:
	<pre>
   &lt;script th:src="${resources + '/script.js'}" src="resources/script.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
   &lt;link rel="stylesheet" th:href="${resources + '/style.css'}" href="resources/style.css"&gt;
   &lt;img th:src="${resources + '/image.png'}" src="resources/image.png"&gt;
</pre>
	The 'traditional-html-plus' template includes examples of JavaScript,
	CSS and image resources.

	<H2>Data Available</H2>
	The following data items are available to all reports. These can be
	accessed via the Thymeleaf Standard Dialect, e.g.
	<code>${reportTitle}</code>

	<H3>alertTree</H3>
	A tree containing all of the alerts that should be included in the
	report. This is a copy of the standard ZAP alert tree shown in the
	Desktop 'Alerts' tab but pruned to remove any alerts that do not match
	the criteria selected.
	<p>
		Every node in the tree is an <a
			href="https://javadoc.io/static/org.zaproxy/zap/2.10.0/org/zaproxy/zap/extension/alert/AlertNode.html">AlertNode</a>.
	</p>
	<p>The top level node does not include any useful data.</p>
	<p>
		There is one second level node for each type of alert found. These
		nodes have a 'userObject' of type <a
			href="https://javadoc.io/static/org.zaproxy/zap/2.10.0/org/parosproxy/paros/core/scanner/Alert.html">Alert</a>
		which gives you access to all of the alert data and the associated
		request and response.
	</p>
	<p>The 3rd and final level contains the alert instances - these are
		all the same type as their parent node and give access to the alert
		details in the same way.</p>
	<H3>reportTitle</H3>
	The title of the report set by the user.

	<H3>description</H3>
	The description of the report set by the user.

	<H3>helper</H3>
	An instance of the
	<a
		href="https://github.com/zaproxy/zap-extensions/tree/main/addOns/reports/src/main/java/org/zaproxy/addon/reports/ReportHelper.java">ReportHelper</a>
	class that provides useful methods, including:
	<ul>
		<li><code>getConfidenceString(int confidence)</code> Returns an
			internationalised string for the associated confidence code</li>
		<li><code>getRiskString(int risk)</code> Returns an
			internationalised string for the associated risk code</li>
		<li><code>getHttpStatusCode(int code)</code> Returns the meaning
			of the specified HTTP status code</li>
		<li><code>getHostForSite(String site)</code> Returns the hostname
			for a given site URL</li>
		<li><code>getPortForSite(String site)</code> Returns the port for
			a given site URL</li>
		<li><code>isSslSite(String site)</code> Returns true if the given
			site URL is using SSL</li>
		<li><code>getStatisticsString(String stat)</code> Returns the
			meaning of the specific statistics key - currently only supported for
			authentication stats</li>
		<li><code>getSiteStats(String site, String prefix)</code> Returns
			a Map of the statistics for the given site starting with the
			(optional) prefix</li>
		<li><code>hasSiteStats(String site, String prefix)</code> Returns
			true if the given site has any statistics starting with the
			(optional) prefix</li>
	</ul>

	<H3>alertCounts</H3>

	A Map of risk levels to the number of unique alerts. This can be used
	by reports, for example, to generate a summary table.

	<H3>alertCountsByRule</H3>

	A Map of scan rule IDs to the number of instances.

	<H3>reportData</H3>
	An instance of the
	<a
		href="https://github.com/zaproxy/zap-extensions/tree/main/addOns/reports/src/main/java/org/zaproxy/addon/reports/ReportData.java">ReportData</a>
	class that defines the data to be included in the report. This can be
	used, for example, to tell if there were no level alerts of a specific
	level or if they were deliberately excluded.
	<p>Automation jobs can make additional data available to the
		reports, in many cases even if the automation framework was not used.
		See the help pages for the relevant jobs for more details.</p>

	<H3>reportData : paramsData</H3>
	An instance of the
	<a
		href="https://github.com/zaproxy/zap-extensions/tree/main/addOns/automation/src/main/java/org/zaproxy/addon/automation/jobs/ParamsJobResultData.java">ParamsJobResultData</a>
	class that provides methods for querying the parameters used by sites.
	This is included in the Automation add-on as a "data job" that does not
	provide any additional functionality.

	<H3>stats</H3>
	A Map of the global statistics. The site based statistics are available
	via the helper.

	<H2>Testing Reports</H2>
	ZAP does not cache the report templates, so it rereads them every time
	you generate a report. This makes it much easier to test them. Just
	make sure that the 'Template Directory' parameter is set to the top
	level directory you are using for your reports, then when you create a
	new report it will use the latest version of the template that you have
	saved. You will not need to restart ZAP in order to pick up any changes
	to existing reports that you have made.

	<H2>PDF Reports</H2>
	PDF reports are generated using the
	<a href="https://github.com/flyingsaucerproject/flyingsaucer">Flying
		Saucer</a> library which converts HTML documents into PDF format. In order
	to create a PDF report you need to design it in HTML, call the template
	"report.html" but specify the format as "PDF".
	<p>Note that Flying Saucer requires that the HTML is well-formed
		XML / XHTML. It will fail with an error if the template is not
		well-formed so check the ZAP log file for details.</p>
