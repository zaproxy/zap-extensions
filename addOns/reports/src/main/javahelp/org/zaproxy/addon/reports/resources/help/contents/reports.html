	<H1>Report Generation</H1>
	This add-on allows you to generate a
	<a href="templates.html">variety of reports</a> in a flexible and
	extensible way.
	<p>It provides a dialog that can be accessed via menu "Report /
		Generate Report..." menu item or via the "Generate Report..." toolbar
		button.</p>
	<p>
		It also supports the <a href="automation.html">Automation
			Framework</a>.

	<H1>Generate Report Dialog</H1>

	<H2>Scope Fields</H2>
	The Scope tab has the following fields:

	<H3>Report Title</H3>
	The title that will be used in the report.

	<H3>Report Name</H3>
	The filename that will be used for the report. This name can include
	the following patterns:
	<ul>
		<li><code>{{</code><i>date/time pattern</i> <code>}}</code> Any
			Java Date/Time pattern, e.g. <code>yyyy-MM-dd</code></li>
		<li><code>[[site]]</code> The name of the first site selected</li>
	</ul>
	The name will be automatically updated with the site selected and
	extension for the report type.
	<p>To change the default name used change the 'Report Name Pattern'

	</p>
	<H3>Report Directory</H3>
	The directory into which the report will be written. This directory
	will be selected when the dialog is next opened.

	<H3>Description</H3>
	The description that will be included in the report.

	<H3>Contexts</H3>
	A list of all of the Contexts currently available. Select one or more
	to only include alerts and other information from those contexts in the
	report. You can use the shift or control keys to select and unselect
	more than one context.
	<p>By default all contexts will be included.</p>
	<H3>Sites</H3>
	A list of all of the Sites currently available. Select one or more to
	only include alerts and other information from those sites in the
	report. You can use the shift or control keys to select and unselect
	more than one site.
	<p>By default all sites will be included.</p>
	<p>If you select sites that are not in the contexts that you have
		also selected then no data will be included in the report.</p>
	<H3>Generate If No Alerts</H3>
	By default the dialog will prevent you from generating a report with no
	alerts. Select this check box if you do want to generate a report with
	no alerts.

	<H3>Display Report</H3>
	If selected then ZAP will attempt to open the report using the default
	program used by your operating system for that report type.

	<H2>Template Fields</H2>
	The Template tab has the following fields:

	<H3>Template</H3>
	A pulldown containing all of the available templates. The template
	names include the format that they will be generated in, e.g. HTML, MD,
	PDF etc.

	<H3>Theme</H3>
	Templates may optionally define 'themes' - typically different colours
	and styles which apply to the same content. If any themes are defined
	for the selected template then you can select them here.

	<H3>Sections</H3>
	Templates may optionally define 'sections' - parts of the report which
	can be included or excluded. If the selected template defines sections
	then a checkbox for each section will be displayed here. By default all
	checkboxes will be selected. If you unselect any of the sections then
	they will not be included in the report.

	<H2>Filter Fields</H2>
	The Filter tab has the following fields:

	<H3>Include Risks</H3>
	Include alerts with the selected risks.

	<H3>Include Confidences</H3>
	Include alerts with the selected confidences.

	<H2>Options Fields</H2>
	The Options tab has the following fields:

	<H3>Report Name Pattern</H3>
	The pattern that will be used to generate the report name.

	<H3>Template Directory</H3>
	The directory from which templates will be loaded. You should not
	typically need to change unless you are designing new reports, in which
	case it can be useful to change to point to your local source code
	reports directory. The "reports" folder in your ZAP home directory is
	used by default.
