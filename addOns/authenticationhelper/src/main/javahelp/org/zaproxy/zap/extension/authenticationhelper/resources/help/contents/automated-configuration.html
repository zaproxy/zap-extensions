	<h1>Automated configuration</h1>
	<p>
		This feature will be available once ZAP 2.8.0 is released. For HTTP
		based authentication schemes, setting up authentication means clicking
		<img src="images/key-plus.png" width="16" height="16" /> button in
		the main toolbar and manually(only once) signing in to the web
		application while proxying through ZAP.
	</p>
	<p>For non-HTTP based schemes, in addition to manually signing in
		to the web application, you also need to provide logged in or logged
		out indicator. All other configurations are handled automatically.</p>
