	<h1>Authentication status scanning</h1>
	<p>Having a good configuration does not necessarily mean
		authentication is successful. What if the credentials are wrong or
		provided logged in/out indicator is misleading. With this feature, you
		can check the authentication status of each URI. The scan results are
		shown in authentication status tab as shown in this picture</p>

		Authentication status scanning is started using <a
			href="authentication-helper-dialog.html">authentication helper
			dialog</a>.
	</p>

	<h2 id="status">Authentication status</h2>
	<p>Authentication status indicates whether ZAP can authenticate
		with the web application successfully or not. Unfortunately, for
		non-HTTP based authentication schemes, there is no perfect approach to
		determine authentication status programmatically. ZAP uses logged in
		indicator and logged out indicator to assess the authentication
		status. For each HTTP(S) request that is proxied through ZAP, the
		response message(both header and body) is scanned to match provided
		logged in and logged out indicators. Based on this result the
		authentication status is determined. As a result of this, the
		determined authentication status is just ZAP's understanding of
		authentication state, and it purely depends on the provided
		indicators.</p>
	<p>As you already guessed, based on the presence of provided logged
		in indicator and logged out indicator in the response message, the
		authentication status can have four states. It must be noted that it
		is not necessary to define both indicators, however at least one of
		the indicator should be defined to start checking the authentication
		status.</p>
	<p>Below table illustrates the four authentication states.</p>

	<table border="1">
		<thead>
			<tr>
				<th>Authentication Status</th>
				<th>Icon</th>
				<th>Logged in indicator</th>
				<th>Logged out indicator</th>
			</tr>

		<tbody>
			<tr>
				<td>Successful authentication</td>
				<td align="center"><img src="images/tick-circle.png" /></td>
				<td>Found</td>
				<td>Not found or not defined</td>

	<h2>Indicator status</h2>
	<p>As described earlier the authentication status is determined by
		the presence of logged in and logged out indicators in the response
		message. Below table describes the different state of an indicator.</p>

	<table border="1">
		<thead>
			<tr>
				<th>Indicator Status</th>
				<th>Icon</th>
				<th>Description</th>
			</tr>
		</thead>
		<tbody>
			<tr>
				<td>Found</td>
				<td align="center"><img src="images/tick.png" /></td>
				<td>The indicator is found in the response message</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>Not found</td>
				<td align="center"><img src="images/cross.png" /></td>
				<td>The indicator is not found in the response message</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>Not defined</td>
				<td align="center"><img src="images/ash-circle.png" /></td>
				<td>User has not provided the indicator</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>Could not verify</td>
				<td align="center"><img src="images/red-circle.png" /></td>
				<td>ZAP was unable to determine the indicator state</td>
			</tr>
