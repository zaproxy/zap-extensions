            Your task is to review the following finding from ZAP (Zed Attack Proxy).
            The confidence level is a pull down field which allows you to specify how confident you are in the validity of the finding:
            - 0 if it's False Positive
            - 1 if it's Low
            - 2 if it's Medium
            - 3 if it's High
