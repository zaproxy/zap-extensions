The replacer is an easy way to replace strings in requests and responses.
<p>
It is accessible via the Options and by default it can be quickly accessed via the '&lt;ctrl&gt; R' hotkey.
<p>
The Replacer Options panel allows you to define as many replacement rules as you need.<br>
Each rule is defined by the following fields:
<h3>Description</h3>
A description that allows you to identify the rule.

<h3>Match Type</h3>
May be one of:

<h4>Request Header (will add if not present)</h4>
In this case the 'Match String' will be treated as a header name. 
If the header is present then its value will be replaced by the replacement text. 
If the replacement text is empty then the header will be removed (if present).
If the header is not present and the replacement text is not empty then the header will be added.

<h4>Request Header String</h4>
In this case the 'Match String' will be treated as a string or regex expression.
If it is present in the request header then it will be replaced by the replacement text.

<h4>Request Body String</h4>
In this case the 'Match String' will be treated as a string or regex expression.
If it is present in the request body then it will be replaced by the replacement text.

<h4>Response Header (will add if not present)</h4>
In this case the 'Match String' will be treated as a header name. 
If the header is present then its value will be replaced by the replacement text. 
If the replacement text is empty then the header will be removed (if present).
If the header is not present and the replacement text is not empty then the header will be added.

<h4>Response Header String</h4>
In this case the 'Match String' will be treated as a string or regex expression.
If it is present in the response header then it will be replaced by the replacement text.

<h4>Response Body String</h4>
In this case the 'Match String' will be treated as a string or regex expression.
If it is present in the response body then it will be replaced by the replacement text.

<h3>Match String</h3>
The string that will be used to identify what should be replaced - see Match Type for details.

<h3>Match Regex</h3>
If set then the Match String will be treated as a regex expression.
This option is disabled when matching actual headers.
Hexadecimal bytes are represented with "\x00 - \xFF" (for example "abc\x01\x02\x03def").

<h3>Replacement String</h3>
The new string that will replace the specified selection.
Hexadecimal bytes are represented with "\x00 - \xFF".
The literal string "\x00" can be kept with "\\x00".

<h3>Enable</h3>
If not set then the rule will not apply.

<h3>Initiators tab</h3>
Allows you to specify which 'initiators' the rule should apply to.
Each ZAP component which can send and receive messages is a separate initiator, so this gives you a very fine grain
control over exactly when the rule should apply.

<p>
If you need even more control over when and how text should be replaced then you can use the ZAP Script Console which
gives you complete control over the ZAP messages.
