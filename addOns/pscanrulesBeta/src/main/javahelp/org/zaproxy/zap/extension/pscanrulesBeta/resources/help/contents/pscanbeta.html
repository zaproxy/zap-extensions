<H1>Passive Scan Rules - Beta</H1>
The following beta quality passive scan rules are included in this add-on:

<H2>Cookie - Loosely Scoped</H2>
Cookies can be scoped by domain or path. This check is only concerned with domain scope.The domain scope applied to a cookie determines which domains can access it. For example, a cookie can be scoped strictly to a subdomain e.g. www.nottrusted.com, or loosely scoped to a parent domain e.g. nottrusted.com. In the latter case, any subdomain of nottrusted.com can access the cookie. Loosely scoped cookies are common in mega-applications like google.com and live.com.

<H2>CSRF Countermeasures</H2>
This scanner identifies "potential" vulnerabilities with the lack of known CSRF 
countermeasures in pages with forms.<br>
At HIGH alert threshold only scans messages which are in scope.<br>
Post 2.5.0 you can specify a comma separated list of identifiers in the 
<code>rules.csrf.ignorelist</code> parameter via the Options 'Rule configuration' panel.
Any FORMs with a name or ID that matches one of these identifiers will be ignored when scanning for missing Anti-CSRF tokens.
Only use this feature to ignore FORMs that you know are safe, for example search forms.


<H2>Information Disclosure: Debug Errors</H2>
This passive scanner checks the content of web responses for known Debug Error message fragments.
Access to such details may provide a malicious individual with means by which to further abuse the web site.
They may also leak data not specifically meant for end user consumption.<br>
Note: Javascript responses are only assessed at LOW threshold.

<H2>Information Disclosure: In URL</H2>
Attempts to identify the existence of sensitive details within the visited URIs themselves 
(this may include parameters, document names, directory names, etc.).

<H2>Information Disclosure: Referrer</H2>
Identifies the existence of sensitive details within the the Referrer header field of HTTP requests
(this may include parameters, document names, directory names, etc.).

<H2>Information Disclosure: Suspicious Comments</H2>
Analyzes web content to identify comments which contain potentially sensitive details. Which may lead to 
further attack or exposure of unintended data.

<H2>Insecure Authentication</H2>
HTTP basic or digest authentication has been used over an unsecured connection. The credentials can be read and then reused by someone with access to the network.

<H2>Insecure JSF ViewState</H2>
The response at the following URL contains a ViewState value that has no cryptographic protections.

<H2>Servlet Parameter Pollution</H2>
Searches response content for HTML forms which fail to specify an action element. Version 3 of the 
Java Servlet spec calls for aggregation of query string and post data elements which may result in 
unintended handling of user controlled data. This may impact other frameworks and technologies as well.

<H2>VIEWSTATE</H2>
Attempts to identify VIEWSTATE parameters and analyze said parameters for various best practices or protective 
measures such as: 
<ul>
	<li>Those based on ASP.NET 1.0 and 1.1.</li>
	<li>VIEWSTATE Lacking signature.</li>
	<li>Split VIEWSTATE.</li>
	<li>VIEWSTATE containing email or IP patterns.</li>
</ul>
