pscanbeta.retrievedfromcache.name = Retrieved from Cache
pscanbeta.retrievedfromcache.desc = The content was retrieved from a shared cache. If the response data is sensitive, personal or user-specific, this may result in sensitive information being leaked. In some cases, this may even result in a user gaining complete control of the session of another user, depending on the configuration of the caching components in use in their environment. This is primarily an issue where caching servers such as "proxy" caches are configured on the local network. This configuration is typically found in corporate or educational environments, for instance. 
pscanbeta.retrievedfromcache.refs = https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7234\nhttps://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231\nhttp://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec13.html (obsoleted by rfc7234)
pscanbeta.retrievedfromcache.soln = Validate that the response does not contain sensitive, personal or user-specific information.  If it does, consider the use of the following HTTP response headers, to limit, or prevent the content being stored and retrieved from the cache by another user:\nCache-Control: no-cache, no-store, must-revalidate, private\nPragma: no-cache\nExpires: 0\nThis configuration directs both HTTP 1.0 and HTTP 1.1 compliant caching servers to not store the response, and to not retrieve the response (without validation) from the cache, in response to a similar request.
pscanbeta.retrievedfromcache.extrainfo = {0}
pscanbeta.retrievedfromcache.extrainfo.http11ageheader = The presence of the 'Age' header indicates that that a HTTP/1.1 compliant caching server is in use.

pscanbeta.usercontrolledcharset.name=User Controllable Charset
pscanbeta.usercontrolledcharset.desc=This check looks at user-supplied input in query string parameters and POST data to identify where Content-Type or meta tag charset declarations might be user-controlled. Such charset declarations should always be declared by the application. If an attacker can control the response charset, they could manipulate the HTML to perform XSS or other attacks. For example, an attacker controlling the <meta> element charset value is able to declare UTF-7 and is also able to include enough user-controlled payload early in the HTML document to have it interpreted as UTF-7. By encoding their payload with UTF-7 the attacker is able to bypass any server-side XSS protections and embed script in the page.
pscanbeta.usercontrolledcharset.refs=
pscanbeta.usercontrolledcharset.soln=Force UTF-8 in all charset declarations. If user-input is required to decide a charset declaration, ensure that only an allowed list is used.

pscanbeta.usercontrolledcookie.name=Cookie Poisoning
pscanbeta.usercontrolledcookie.desc=This check looks at user-supplied input in query string parameters and POST data to identify where cookie parameters might be controlled. This is called a cookie poisoning attack, and becomes exploitable when an attacker can manipulate the cookie in various ways. In some cases this will not be exploitable, however, allowing URL parameters to set cookie values is generally considered a bug.
pscanbeta.usercontrolledcookie.refs=http://websecuritytool.codeplex.com/wikipage?title=Checks#user-controlled-cookie
pscanbeta.usercontrolledcookie.soln=Do not allow user input to control cookie names and values. If some query string parameters must be set in cookie values, be sure to filter out semicolon's that can serve as name/value pair delimiters.
pscanbeta.usercontrolledcookie.extrainfo.get=An attacker may be able to poison cookie values through URL parameters.  Try injecting a semicolon to see if you can add cookie values (e.g. name=controlledValue;name=anotherValue;).\n\n
pscanbeta.usercontrolledcookie.extrainfo.post=An attacker may be able to poison cookie values through POST parameters. To test if this is a more serious issue, you should try resending that request as a GET, with the POST parameter included as a query string parameter. For example:  http://nottrusted.com/page?value=maliciousInput.\r\n\r\n
pscanbeta.usercontrolledcookie.extrainfo={0}This was identified at:\r\n\r\n{1}\r\n\r\nUser-input was found in the following cookie:\r\n{2}\r\n\r\nThe user input was:\r\n{3}={4}

pscanbeta.usercontrolledjavascriptevent.name=User Controllable JavaScript Event (XSS)
pscanbeta.usercontrolledjavascriptevent.desc=This check looks at user-supplied input in query string parameters and POST data to identify where certain HTML attribute values might be controlled. This provides hot-spot detection for XSS (cross-site scripting) that will require further review by a security analyst to determine exploitability.            
pscanbeta.usercontrolledjavascriptevent.refs=http://websecuritytool.codeplex.com/wikipage?title=Checks#user-javascript-event
pscanbeta.usercontrolledjavascriptevent.soln=Validate all input and sanitize output it before writing to any Javascript on* events.
pscanbeta.usercontrolledjavascriptevent.extrainfo=User-controlled javascript event(s) was found. Exploitability will need to be manually determined. The page at the following URL:\r\n\r\n{0}\"\r\n\r\nincludes the following Javascript event which may be attacker-controllable: \r\n\r\nUser-input was found in the following data of an [{1}] event:\r\n{2}\r\n\r\nThe user input was:\r\n{3}

pscanbeta.usercontrolledhtmlattributes.name=User Controllable HTML Element Attribute (Potential XSS)
pscanbeta.usercontrolledhtmlattributes.desc=This check looks at user-supplied input in query string parameters and POST data to identify where certain HTML attribute values might be controlled. This provides hot-spot detection for XSS (cross-site scripting) that will require further review by a security analyst to determine exploitability.
pscanbeta.usercontrolledhtmlattributes.refs=http://websecuritytool.codeplex.com/wikipage?title=Checks#user-controlled-html-attribute
pscanbeta.usercontrolledhtmlattributes.soln=Validate all input and sanitize output it before writing to any HTML attributes.
pscanbeta.usercontrolledhtmlattributes.extrainfo=User-controlled HTML attribute values were found. Try injecting special characters to see if XSS might be possible. The page at the following URL:\r\n\r\n{0}\r\n\r\nappears to include user input in: \r\n\r\na(n) [{1}] tag [{2}] attribute \r\n\r\nThe user input found was:\r\n{3}={4}\r\n\r\nThe user-controlled value was:\r\n{5}

pscanbeta.usercontrolledopenredirect.name=Open Redirect
pscanbeta.usercontrolledopenredirect.desc=Open redirects are one of the OWASP 2010 Top Ten vulnerabilities. This check looks at user-supplied input in query string parameters and POST data to identify where open redirects might be possible. Open redirects occur when an application allows user-supplied input (e.g. http://nottrusted.com) to control an offsite redirect. This is generally a pretty accurate way to find where 301 or 302 redirects could be exploited by spammers or phishing attacks.\n\nFor example an attacker could supply a user with the following link: http://example.com/example.php?url=http://malicious.example.com.
pscanbeta.usercontrolledopenredirect.soln=To avoid the open redirect vulnerability, parameters of the application script/program must be validated before sending 302 HTTP code (redirect) to the client browser. Implement safe redirect functionality that only redirects to relative URI's, or a list of trusted domains
pscanbeta.usercontrolledopenredirect.refs=https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Unvalidated_Redirects_and_Forwards_Cheat_Sheet.html\nhttps://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/601.html

pscanbeta.usercontrolledopenredirect.extrainfo.post=An open redirect controlled by POST parameters was detected. To test if this is a more serious issue, you should try resending that request as a GET, with the POST parameter included as a query string parameter. For example: http://nottrusted.com/page?url=http://lookout.net.\r\n\r\nThe 301 or 302 response to a request for the following URL appeared to contain user input in the location header:\r\n\r\n
pscanbeta.usercontrolledopenredirect.extrainfo.common={0}\r\n\r\nThe user input found was:\r\n\r\n{1}={2}\r\n\r\nThe context was:\r\n\r\n{3}
