pscanbeta.authenticationcredentialscaptured.name=Authentication Credentials Captured
pscanbeta.authenticationcredentialscaptured.desc=An insecure authentication mechanism is in use. This allows an attacker on the network access to the userid and password of the authenticated user. For Basic Authentication, the attacker must merely monitor the network traffic until a Basic Authentication request is received, and then base64 decode the username and password.  For Digest Authentication, the attacker has access to the username, and possibly also the password, if the hash (including a nonce) can be successfully cracked, or if a Man-In-The-Middle attack is mounted.\nThe attacker eavesdrops on the network until an authentication has completed.
pscanbeta.authenticationcredentialscaptured.soln=Use HTTPS, and use a secure authentication mechanism that does not transmit the userid or password in an un-encrypted fashion.  In particular, avoid use of the Basic Authentication mechanism, since this trivial obfuscation mechanism is easily broken.

pscanbeta.cookielooselyscoped.name=Loosely Scoped Cookie
pscanbeta.cookielooselyscoped.desc=Cookies can be scoped by domain or path. This check is only concerned with domain scope.The domain scope applied to a cookie determines which domains can access it. For example, a cookie can be scoped strictly to a subdomain e.g. www.nottrusted.com, or loosely scoped to a parent domain e.g. nottrusted.com. In the latter case, any subdomain of nottrusted.com can access the cookie. Loosely scoped cookies are common in mega-applications like google.com and live.com. Cookies set from a subdomain like app.foo.bar are transmitted only to that domain by the browser. However, cookies scoped to a parent-level domain may be transmitted to the parent, or any subdomain of the parent.
pscanbeta.cookielooselyscoped.soln=Always scope cookies to a FQDN (Fully Qualified Domain Name).
pscanbeta.cookielooselyscoped.refs=https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6265#section-4.1\nhttps://www.owasp.org/index.php/Testing_for_cookies_attributes_(OTG-SESS-002)\nhttp://code.google.com/p/browsersec/wiki/Part2#Same-origin_policy_for_cookies
