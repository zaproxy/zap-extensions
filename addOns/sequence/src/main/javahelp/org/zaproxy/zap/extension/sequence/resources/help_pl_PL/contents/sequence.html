<h1>Sequence Scanner</h1>
This add-on facilitates the recording and scanning sequences of requests. 
In some web applications it is necessary for particular events or pages to be accessed or completed in a certain order.
By recording a sequence and then scanning it, it is possible to ensure such flows happen in an expected manner.

<h2>Creating Sequences</h2>
<p>
One sequence script should be created for each multi-step operation in the application/site being tested.
</p>
There are two options for creating sequences:
<br><br>
<ol>
<li>In either the Sites tree or History tab select the requests you wish to have included, right click, and 
use "Add To Zest Script" (either choosing to create a new script or adding to an existing Sequence script).</li>
<li>From the main tool bar, use the "Record a New Zest Script..." button, selecting "Sequence" as the type.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Scanning</h2>
When a new Active Scan is created there is a "Sequence" tab in which you can choose the sequence(s) to be scanned. 
Note: The Sequence tab is only visible when "Show advanced options" is selected. 
For Example:<br>
