<H1>Plug-n-Hack Clients tab</H1>
<p>
	Plug-n-Hack allows you to monitor client (browser) events in order to help test HTML5 applications.<br>
	In order to support as wide a range of modern browsers as possible this is implemented by injecting javascript
	into the response returned to the browser.<br>
	As it means changing the response this functionality has to be manually enabled. 
</p>
<p>
	To receive client events:
	<ul>
	<li>Access the pages you want to monitor while proxying through ZAP</li>
	<li>Right click in the relevant node(s) in the Sites tree and select 'Monitor clients -> Include subtree'</li>
	<li>Force your browser to reload those pages</li>
	<li>Client events (such as postMessage, click, mouseover, etc.) will then be listed in this tab - select them to see the full details.</li>
	</ul>
</p>
<p>
	The injected javascript sends a heartbeat to ZAP, so ZAP can display all of the 'active' clients in this tab.<br>
	In this case 'active' clients are pages that are currently open in a browser tab.<br>
	You can edit and resend any event via a right click menu item as long as the original client is active.<br>
</p>
<p>
	You can also intercept and change postMessages on the fly.<br>
	Client messages are intercepted if the ‘break on all requests’ button is selected on the top level toolbar.<br> 
	You can also set custom client breakpoints via a button on the Clients tab.<br>
	<br>
	You can fuzz postMessages in the same way as any other message - highlight the string you want to fuzz in the Request tab, right click and select “Fuzz”.<br>
	This option will only be available if the relevant browser still has that page open,as PnH sends the payloads to the browser.<br>
	Standard ‘XSS’ payloads can be used to detect DOM XSS vulnerabilities, but you will need to manually monitor the UI to see if any of them are successful.<br>
	<br>
	PnH also adds a Custom fuzzing file called “PlugnHack DOM XSS Oracle”.<br>
	This file is based on the OWASP XSS cheatsheet and invokes an ‘xss’ JavaScript method that is injected into the page. <br>
	This method invokes the ZAP API which in turn flags the relevant attack in the UI - these are confirmed DOM XSS vulnerabilities, 
	although (as always) you should check that they can really be exploited in the application you are testing without a tool like ZAP.<br>
