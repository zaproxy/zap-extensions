<p>
	Plug-n-Hack is a proposed standard from the Mozilla security team for defining how security tools can interact 
	with browsers in a more useful and usable way. 
</p>
<p>
	This add-on adds a 'Plug-n-Hack' button to the Quickstart tab - clicking on this button will allow you to configure
	your browser to work with ZAP quickly and easily.
</p>
<p>
	It also allows you to control ZAP from your browser. In Firefox this is supported via the Developer Toolbar (Shift+F2).<br>
	Type 'help pnh' or 'help zap' in the Firefox Developer toolbar to get started.
</p>
<p>
	Plug-n-Hack is currently supported by Firefox 24.0 and later. <br>
	For more details about Plug-n-Hack including the latest information about which browsers and tools 
	support it see: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Plug-n-Hack
