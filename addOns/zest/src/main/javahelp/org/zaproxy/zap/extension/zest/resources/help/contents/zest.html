<H1>Zest</H1>
<p>
Zest is an experimental specialized scripting language (also known as a domain-specific language) 
developed by the Mozilla security team and is intended to be used in web oriented security tools.
<p>
It is included by default with ZAP.<br>

<H2>Creating Zest scripts</H2>

There are a variety of ways to create Zest scripts:

<H3>Record a new Zest script Button</H3>
<ul>
<li>Press the 'Record a new Zest script' button on the main toolbar</li>
<li>Type in a suitable name for your script in the 'Add a Zest Script' dialog</li>
<li>Select the prefix you want to record requests for, or leave blank to record all requests</li>
<li>Press the 'Save' button</li>
<li>The 'Record a new Zest script' button will stay pressed, change to 'Recording a new Zest script' and show a red icon.</li>
</ul>
The new Zest script will be shown in the Scripts tab with a red 'recording' icon.<br>
Any requests that you make underneath the specified prefix will be added to the script.<br>
Press the 'Recording a new Zest script' again to stop recording the requests.<br>
Note that you can only record 'Stand Alone' Zest scripts in this way. If you want to create other types of Zest script you must use another mechanism.
<br><br>
You can also right click any Stand Alone Zest script and use the 'Start recording' and 'Stop recording' buttons. 

<H3>New Script Button</H3>
<ul>
<li>Navigate to the Scripts tree tab</li>
<li>Press the 'New Script...' button</li>
<li>Type in a suitable name for your script in the 'New Script' dialog</li>
<li>Select the script type (see the Scripts add-on help page for more details)</li>
<li>Select the Zest script engine</li>
<li>Select one of the templates (if relevant)</li>
<li>Press the 'Save' button</li>
</ul>
Any type of Zest script can be created this way.

<H3>Right clicking a Zest template</H3>
<ul>
<li>Navigate to the Scripts tree tab</li>
<li>Expand the 'Templates' node and find a template you want to use</li>
<li>Right click on the template and select 'New Script...'</li>
<li>Press the 'Save' button</li>
</ul>
Any type of Zest script can be created this way.

<H3>Right clicking requests</H3>
<ul>
<li>Navigate to any tab that shows requests, such as the History tab</li>
<li>Select one or more requests</li>
<li>Right click on them</li>
<li>Select the 'Add to Zest Script' menu which allows you to select an existing Stand Alone script or create a new one</li>
</ul>
Note that you can only add request to 'Stand Alone' Zest scripts.

<H3>Plug-n-Hack</H3>
If you are using a recent version of Firefox then you can create Zest scripts from within your browser.<br>
<ul>
<li>Press the 'Plug-n-Hack' button on the ZAP 'Quick Start' tab</li>
<li>Install the Plug-n-Hack Firefox Add-on and accept all of the dialogs</li>
<li>Press 'Shift F2' in Firefox to access the Developer Toolbar</li>
<li>Type 'zap record on global' to start recording a new Zest script</li>
<li>Any requests you make through ZAP will be added to the script</li>
<li>Type 'zap record off global' to stop recording the script</li>
</ul>
Note that you can only record 'Stand Alone' Zest scripts in this way. If you want to create other types of Zest script you must use another mechanism.

<H2>Editing Zest scripts</H2>
Zest scripts are edited graphically in the Scripts tree tab.<br>
Each statement is a node in the tree - double click nodes to edit the statement properties.<br>
You can add, move and remove statements via right clicking the Zest nodes.<br>
You can also add requests to 'Stand alone' Zest scripts by right clicking the requests in any of the other tabs.<br>
There are also some right click options available when you select text in the Request or Response tabs.<br>
<br>
Zest includes a set of 'built in' variables as well as allowing you to declare your own.<br>
A right click menu is provided (where relevant) in the edit dialogs to allow you to paste in any of the available variable names.<br>
