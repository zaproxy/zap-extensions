ascanalpha.apacherangeheaderdosscanner.name=Apache Range Header DoS (CVE-2011-3192)
ascanalpha.apacherangeheaderdosscanner.desc=The byterange filter in earlier versions of the Apache HTTP Server allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (memory and CPU exhaustion) via a Range request header that identifies multiple overlapping ranges. This issue was exploited in the wild in August 2011.
ascanalpha.apacherangeheaderdosscanner.soln=Upgrade your Apache server to a currently stable version. Alternative solutions or workarounds are outlined in the references. 
ascanalpha.apacherangeheaderdosscanner.refs=https\://httpd.apache.org/security/CVE-2011-3192.txt\nhttp\://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name\=cve-2011-3192

ascanalpha.cookieslack.name=Cookie Slack Detector
ascanalpha.cookieslack.desc=Repeated GET requests\: drop a different cookie each time, followed by normal request with all cookies to stabilize session, compare responses against original baseline GET. This can reveal areas where cookie based authentication/attributes are not actually enforced.
ascanalpha.cookieslack.otherinfo.intro=Cookies that don't have expected effects can reveal flaws in application logic. In the worst case, this can reveal where authentication via cookie token(s) is not actually enforced.\n
ascanalpha.cookieslack.session.warning=NOTE\: Because of its name this cookie may be important, but dropping it appears to have no effect\: [{0}] \n
ascanalpha.cookieslack.affect.response.yes=These cookies affected the response\: 
ascanalpha.cookieslack.affect.response.no=These cookies did NOT affect the response\: 
ascanalpha.cookieslack.session.destroyed=Dropping this cookie appears to have invalidated the session\: [{0}] A follow-on request with all original cookies still had a different response than the original request. \n

ascanalpha.elmahscanner.name=ELMAH Information Leak
ascanalpha.elmahscanner.desc=The Error Logging Modules and Handlers (ELMAH [elmah.axd]) HTTP Module was found to be available. This module can leak a significant amount of valuable information.
ascanalpha.elmahscanner.otherinfo=Based on response status code ELMAH may be protected by an authentication or authorization mechanism.  
ascanalpha.elmahscanner.refs=https\://www.troyhunt.com/aspnet-session-hijacking-with-google/\nhttps\://www.nuget.org/packages/elmah\nhttps\://elmah.github.io/
ascanalpha.elmahscanner.soln=Consider whether or not ELMAH is actually required in production, if it isn't then disable it. If it is then ensure access to it requires authentication and authorization. See also\: https\://elmah.github.io/a/securing-error-log-pages/

ascanalpha.examplefile.name=An example active scan rule which loads data from a file
ascanalpha.examplefile.desc=Add more information about the vulnerability here
ascanalpha.examplefile.other=This is for information that doesnt fit in any of the other sections
ascanalpha.examplefile.soln=A general description of how to solve the problem
ascanalpha.examplefile.refs=http\://zaproxy.blogspot.co.uk/2014/04/hacking-zap-4-active-scan-rules.html

ascanalpha.getforpostscanner.name=GET for POST
ascanalpha.getforpostscanner.desc=A request that was originally observed as a POST was also accepted as a GET. This issue does not represent a security weakness unto itself, however, it may facilitate simplification of other attacks. For example if the original POST is subject to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), then this finding may indicate that a simplified (GET based) XSS may also be possible.
ascanalpha.getforpostscanner.soln=Ensure that only POST is accepted where POST is expected.

ascanalpha.httponlysite.name=HTTP Only Site
ascanalpha.httponlysite.desc=The site is only served under HTTP and not HTTPS.
ascanalpha.httponlysite.soln=Configure your web or application server to use SSL (https).
ascanalpha.httponlysite.refs=https\://www.owasp.org/index.php/Transport_Layer_Protection_Cheat_Sheet\nhttps\://www.owasp.org/index.php/SSL_Best_Practices\nhttps\://letsencrypt.org/
ascanalpha.httponlysite.otherinfo={0}\nZAP attempted to connect via\: {1}
ascanalpha.httponlysite.otherinfo.connectionfail=Failed to connect.
ascanalpha.httponlysite.otherinfo.differenthosts=Different Hosts.
ascanalpha.httponlysite.otherinfo.redirectionlimit=Redirection limit reached.
ascanalpha.httponlysite.otherinfo.noredirection=There was no automatic redirection.
ascanalpha.httponlysite.otherinfo.nossl=Site has no SSL/TLS support.
ascanalpha.httponlysite.otherinfo.redirecttohttp=Redirected to HTTP.
ascanalpha.httponlysite.otherinfo.urinotencoded=Redirection URI couldn't be encoded.

ascanalpha.httpoxy.name=Httpoxy - Proxy Header Misuse
ascanalpha.httpoxy.desc=The server initiated a proxied request via the proxy specified in the HTTP Proxy header of the request.\nHttpoxy typically affects code running in CGI or CGI like environments.\n\nThis may allow attackers to\:\n\n* Proxy the outgoing HTTP requests made by the web application\n\n* Direct the server to open outgoing connections to an address and port of their choosing or\n\n* Tie up server resources by forcing the vulnerable software to use a malicious proxy
ascanalpha.httpoxy.otherinfo=An outgoing message to {0} was proxied via the host and port that ZAP injected into the HTTP Proxy header.
ascanalpha.httpoxy.soln=The best immediate mitigation is to block Proxy request headers as early as possible, and before they hit your application.
ascanalpha.httpoxy.refs=https\://httpoxy.org/

ascanalpha.httpsashttpscanner.name=HTTPS Content Available via HTTP
ascanalpha.httpsashttpscanner.desc=Content which was initially accessed via HTTPS (i.e.\: using SSL/TLS encryption) is also accessible via HTTP (without encryption). 
ascanalpha.httpsashttpscanner.soln=Ensure that your web server, application server, load balancer, etc. is configured to only serve such content via HTTPS. Consider implementing HTTP Strict Transport Security.
ascanalpha.httpsashttpscanner.refs=https\://www.owasp.org/index.php/HTTP_Strict_Transport_Security\nhttps\://www.owasp.org/index.php/List_of_useful_HTTP_headers\nhttp\://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_Strict_Transport_Security\nhttp\://caniuse.com/stricttransportsecurity\nhttp\://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6797
ascanalpha.httpsashttpscanner.otherinfo=ZAP attempted to connect via\: {0}

ascanalpha.ldapinjection.name=LDAP Injection
ascanalpha.ldapinjection.desc=LDAP Injection may be possible. It may be possible for an attacker to bypass authentication controls, and to view and modify arbitrary data in the LDAP directory. 
ascanalpha.ldapinjection.soln=Validate and/or escape all user input before using it to create an LDAP query.  In particular, the following characters (or combinations) should be deny listed\:\n&\n|\n\!\n<\n>\n\=\n~\=\n>\=\n<\=\n*\n(\n)\n,\n+\n-\n"\n'\n;\n\\\n/\nNUL character\n 
ascanalpha.ldapinjection.refs=https\://www.owasp.org/index.php/Top_10_2010-A9\nhttp\://www.testingsecurity.com/how-to-test/injection-vulnerabilities/LDAP-Injection\nhttps\://www.owasp.org/index.php/LDAP_injection

ascanalpha.proxydisclosure.name=Proxy Disclosure
ascanalpha.proxydisclosure.desc={0} proxy server(s) were detected or fingerprinted. This information helps a potential attacker to determine \n - A list of targets for an attack against the application.\n - Potential vulnerabilities on the proxy servers that service the application.\n - The presence or absence of any proxy-based components that might cause attacks against the application to be detected, prevented, or mitigated. 
ascanalpha.proxydisclosure.soln=Disable the 'TRACE' method on the proxy servers, as well as the origin web/application server.\nDisable the 'OPTIONS' method on the proxy servers, as well as the origin web/application server, if it is not required for other purposes, such as 'CORS' (Cross Origin Resource Sharing).\nConfigure the web and application servers with custom error pages, to prevent 'fingerprintable' product-specific error pages being leaked to the user in the event of HTTP errors, such as 'TRACK' requests for non-existent pages.\nConfigure all proxies, application servers, and web servers to prevent disclosure of the technology and version information in the 'Server' and 'X-Powered-By' HTTP response headers.\n

ascanalpha.proxydisclosure.extrainfo.traceenabled=The 'TRACE' method is enabled on one or more of the proxy servers, or on the origin server. This method leaks all information submitted from the web browser and proxies back to the user agent. This may facilitate 'Cross Site Tracing' attacks. 

ascanalpha.relativepathconfusion.name=Relative Path Confusion
ascanalpha.relativepathconfusion.desc=The web server is configured to serve responses to ambiguous URLs in a manner that is likely to lead to confusion about the correct "relative path" for the URL. Resources (CSS, images, etc) are also specified in the page response using relative, rather than absolute URLs. In an attack, if the web browser parses the "cross-content" response in a permissive manner, or can be tricked into permissively parsing the "cross-content" response, using techniques such as framing, then the web browser may be fooled into interpreting HTML as CSS (or other content types), leading to an XSS vulnerability.
ascanalpha.relativepathconfusion.soln=Web servers and frameworks should be updated to be configured to not serve responses to ambiguous URLs in such a way that the relative path of such URLs could be mis-interpreted by components on either the client side, or server side.\nWithin the application, the correct use of the "<base>" HTML tag in the HTTP response will unambiguously specify the base URL for all relative URLs in the document.\nUse the "Content-Type" HTTP response header to make it harder for the attacker to force the web browser to mis-interpret the content type of the response.\nUse the "X-Content-Type-Options\: nosniff" HTTP response header to prevent the web browser from "sniffing" the content type of the response.\nUse a modern DOCTYPE such as "<\!doctype html>" to prevent the page from being rendered in the web browser using "Quirks Mode", since this results in the content type being ignored by the web browser.\nSpecify the "X-Frame-Options" HTTP response header to prevent Quirks Mode from being enabled in the web browser using framing attacks.

ascanalpha.relativepathconfusion.extrainfo.morethanonebasetag=More than one <base> tag was specified in the HTML <head> tag to define the location for relative URLs, which is not valid.
ascanalpha.relativepathconfusion.extrainfo.nobasetag=No <base> tag was specified in the HTML <head> tag to define the location for relative URLs.
ascanalpha.relativepathconfusion.extrainfo.contenttypeenabled=A Content Type of "{0}" was specified. If the web browser is employing strict parsing rules, this will prevent cross-content attacks from succeeding. Quirks Mode in the web browser would disable strict parsing.  
ascanalpha.relativepathconfusion.extrainfo.quirksmodeenabledexplicitly=Quirks Mode is explicitly enabled via <meta http-equiv\="{0}", allowing the specified Content Type to be bypassed.
ascanalpha.relativepathconfusion.extrainfo.quirksmodeenabledimplicitly=Quirks Mode is implicitly enabled via the use of an old DOCTYPE with PUBLIC id "{0}", allowing the specified Content Type to be bypassed in some web browsers.
ascanalpha.relativepathconfusion.extrainfo.quirksmodeenabledimplicitlynodoctype=Quirks Mode is implicitly enabled via the absence of a DOCTYPE, allowing the specified Content Type to be bypassed.
ascanalpha.relativepathconfusion.extrainfo.nocontenttype=No Content Type was specified, so Quirks Mode is not required to exploit the vulnerability in the web browser. 
ascanalpha.relativepathconfusion.extrainfo.framingallowed=No X-Frame-Options header was specified, so the page can be framed, and this can be used to enable Quirks Mode, allowing the specified Content Type to be bypassed.
