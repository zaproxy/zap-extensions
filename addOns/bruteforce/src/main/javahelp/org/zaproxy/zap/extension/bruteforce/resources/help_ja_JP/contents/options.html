	<h1>Options Forced Browse screen</h1>
	<p>
		This screen allows you to configure the <a href="concepts.html">Forced Browse</a>
		options:
	<h3>Concurrent scanning threads per host</h3>
	The number of threads the scanner will use per host.
	<br> Increasing the number of threads will speed up the scan but may put extra
	strain on the computer ZAP is running on and the target host.

	<h3>Recursive</h3>
	If checked then the scanner will recurse through all of the sub-directories found.
	<br> This may take a long time.

	<h3>Default file</h3>
	The default file selected when ZAP starts.

	<h3>Add custom Forced Browse file</h3>
	Allows you to add your own files to be used when brute forcing files and directories.
	<br> These should be text files with one file or directory name per line.
	<br> Files are added to the 'dirbuster' directory underneath the ZAP home directory.
