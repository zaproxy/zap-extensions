	<h1>Forced Browse tab</h1>

	The Forced Browse tab allows you to perform a
	<a href="concepts.html">Məcburi İzləmə</a> scan on any of the sites that have been
	accessed.
	<br>
	<br> Sites can be selected via the toolbar or the
	<i>Sites tab</i>.
	<br> Any sites that have have been are are currently being scanned are marked in
	bold in the toolbar Sites pulldown control.
	<br> The toolbar provides a set of buttons which allow you to start, stop, pause and
	resume the scan.
	<br> A progress bar shows how far the scan of the selected site has progressed.
	<br> The 'Current scans' value shows how many scans are currently active - hovering
	over this value will show a list of the sites being scanned in a popup.

	<h2>Right click menu</h2>
	Right clicking on one or more rows will bring up a menu which will allow you to:

	<h3>Exclude from</h3>
	This menu has the following submenus:

	<h4>Proksi</h4>
	This will exclude the selected nodes from the proxy. They will still be proxied via ZAP
	but will not be shown in any of the tabs.
	<br /> This can be used to ignore URLs that you know are not relevant to the system you
	are currently testing.
	<br /> The nodes can be included again via the
	<i>Session Properties</i> dialog

	<h4>Skaner</h4>
	This will prevent the selected notes from being actively scanned.
	<br /> The nodes can be included again via the
	<i>Session Properties</i> dialog

	<h4>Spayder</h4>
	This will prevent the selected nodes from being spidered.
	<br /> The nodes can be included again via the
	<i>Session Properties</i> dialog

	<h3>Kopyala</h3>
	This will copy the selected URLs to the clipboard.

	<h3>Yenidən göndər...</h3>
	This will bring up the
	<i>Resend dialog</i> which allows you to resend the request after making any changes to
	it that you want to.

	<h3>Yeni həyəcan...</h3>
	This will bring up the
	<i>Add Alert dialog</i> which allows you to manually record a new
	<i>alert</i> against this request.

	<h3>URL-i Brauzerdə aç</h3>
	This will open the URL of the selected node in your default browser.

	<h3>Generate anti CSRF test form</h3>
	This will open a URL which will give you a generated form for testing for CSRF issues.
	<br> It will only be enabled for POST requests, if the API is enabled and if Java
	supports the opening of URLs in a browser on your platform.
