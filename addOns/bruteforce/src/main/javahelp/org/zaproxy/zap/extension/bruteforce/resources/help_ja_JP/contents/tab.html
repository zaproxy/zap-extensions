	<h1>Forced Browse tab</h1>

	The Forced Browse tab allows you to perform a
	<a href="concepts.html">強制ブラウズ</a> scan on any of the sites that have been
	accessed.
	<br>
	<br> Sites can be selected via the toolbar or the
	<i>サイトタブ</i>.
	<br> Any sites that have have been are are currently being scanned are marked in
	bold in the toolbar Sites pulldown control.
	<br> The toolbar provides a set of buttons which allow you to start, stop, pause and
	resume the scan.
	<br> A progress bar shows how far the scan of the selected site has progressed.
	<br> The 'Current scans' value shows how many scans are currently active - hovering
	over this value will show a list of the sites being scanned in a popup.
	<br> The toolbar also includes a button to export the displayed content as CSV.

	<h2>右クリック メニュー</h2>
	Right clicking on one or more rows will bring up a menu which will allow you to:

	<h3>以下の処理から除外する:</h3>
	This menu has the following submenus:

	<h4>プロキシ</h4>
	This will exclude the selected nodes from the proxy. They will still be proxied via ZAP
	but will not be shown in any of the tabs.
	<br /> This can be used to ignore URLs that you know are not relevant to the system you
	are currently testing.
	<br /> The nodes can be included again via the
	<i>セッション・プロパティ</i> dialog

	<h4>スキャン</h4>
	This will prevent the selected notes from being actively scanned.
	<br /> The nodes can be included again via the
	<i>セッション・プロパティ</i> dialog

	<h4>スパイダー</h4>
	This will prevent the selected nodes from being spidered.
	<br /> The nodes can be included again via the
	<i>セッション・プロパティ</i> dialog

	<h3>コピー</h3>
	This will copy the selected URLs to the clipboard.

	<h3>再送信...</h3>
	This will bring up the
	<i>再送信ダイアログ</i> which allows you to resend the request after making any changes to
	it that you want to.

	<h3>新しいアラート...</h3>
	This will bring up the
	<i>アラートダイアログを追加</i> which allows you to manually record a new
	<i>alert</i> against this request.

	<h3>ブラウザで表示</h3>
	This will open the URL of the selected node in your default browser.

	<h3>anti CSRF テストフォームを生成</h3>
	This will open a URL which will give you a generated form for testing for CSRF issues.
	<br> It will only be enabled for POST requests, if the API is enabled and if Java
	supports the opening of URLs in a browser on your platform.
