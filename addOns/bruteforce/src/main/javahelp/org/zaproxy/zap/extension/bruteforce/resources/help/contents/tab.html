	The Forced Browse tab allows you to perform a
	<a href="concepts.html">Forced Browse</a> scan on any of the sites that have been
	accessed.
	<br>
	<br> Sites can be selected via the toolbar or the
	<i>Sites tab</i>.
	<br> Any sites that have have been are are currently being scanned are marked in
	bold in the toolbar Sites pulldown control.
	<br> The toolbar provides a set of buttons which allow you to start, stop, pause and
	resume the scan.
	<br> A progress bar shows how far the scan of the selected site has progressed.
	<br> The 'Current scans' value shows how many scans are currently active - hovering

	This menu has the following submenus:

	<H4>Proxy</H4>

	<i>Session Properties</i> dialog

	<i>alert</i> against this request.
