	<H1>Options Forced Browse screen</H1>
	<p>
		This screen allows you to configure the <a href="concepts.html">Forced Browse</a>
		options:
	<H3>Concurrent scanning threads per host</H3>
	The number of threads the scanner will use per host.
	<br> Increasing the number of threads will speed up the scan but may put extra
	strain on the computer ZAP is running on and the target host.

	<H3>Recursive</H3>
	If checked then the scanner will recurse through all of the sub-directories found.
	<br> This may take a long time.

	<H3>Default file</H3>
	The default file selected when ZAP starts.

	<H3>Add custom Forced Browse file</H3>
	Allows you to add your own files to be used when brute forcing files and directories.
	<br> These should be text files with one file or directory name per line.
	<br> Files are added to the 'dirbuster' directory underneath the ZAP home directory.

    <H3>Force Browse files without extension</H3>
    If selected then in addition to brute forcing directories, files without extension will also be brute forced.
    <br> The URI of the file to be brute forced is derived by appending to the base path the entries of the selected forced browse text file.
    <br> By default this option is unchecked.
    <br> Enabling this will increase the scanning time.

	<H3>Force Browse files</H3>
	If checked then in addition to brute forcing directories, the files will also be brute forced.
    <br> The URI of the file to be brute forced is derived by appending given extensions to the entries of selected forced browse text file.
    <br> Users do not need to worry whether the entry already ends with an extension or not. The conflict is handled internally.
    <br> By default this option is unchecked.
    <br> Enabling this will increase the scanning time.
    
    <H3>File extensions</H3>
    If Force Browse files option is checked, then you can specify the file extensions that need to be brute forced.
    <br> When specifying multiple extensions separate each extension with a comma(,).
    <br> If no value is specified, "php" will be used as the default extension.
    
    <H3>File extensions to ignore</H3>
    The scanner parses the response body to filter existing links.
    <br> The extracted links are then used to make new requests.
    <br> If file extensions to ignore is specified then links ending with those extensions are ignored from making requests.
    <br> When specifying multiple extensions separate each extension with a comma(,).
    <br> By default, this is set to "jpg, gif, jpeg, ico, tiff, png, bmp".
    
    <H3>Fail Case String</H3>
    The scanner will request for every file type in every directory that it finds with the given fail case string appended.
    <br> The response from this page is used to determine whether or not a guessed file/directory is there.
    <br> By default, this is set to "thereIsNoWayThat-You-CanBeThere".
    <br> If youâ€™re getting strange results, consider changing this.
