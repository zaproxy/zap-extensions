<H1>Insights Fields</H1>

<H3>Level</H3>

An indication of how significant an Insight is.
<p>
The following Levels are supported:
<ul>
<li>Info: An informational Insight which gives you more information about the target
<li>Low: An Insight which is potentially a problem, depending on how your application works
<li>Medium: A more significant Insight which should be investigated ASAP. It potentially means that the scan is not working as expected
<li>High: A very significant Insight which is highly likely to impact the scan effectiveness
</ul>

We recommend terminating a scan early and investigating if any Medium or High level Insights are reported.

<H3>Reason</H3>
The reason why the Insight was reported.
<p>
It will be one of:
<ul>
<li>Exceeded High: The value exceeded the High threshold
<li>Exceeded Low: The value exceeded the Low threshold
<li>&lt;blank&gt;: Used for Info level Insights
</ul>

<H3>Key</H3>
A string that can be reliably used to identify the Insight.

<H3>Description</H3>
A user friendly description. 
This should not be used to identify Insights programmatically as it may be internationalised or change based on feedback.

<H3>Value</H3>
The value related to the Insight. This will be an integer or a percentage.

<H3>Site</H3>
Indicates if the Insight is specific to a site (which will be specified). Otherwise Insights are not site specific.

<H3>Thresholds</H3>
Each Insight has a Low and High threshold, which is shown in the <a href="insights-list.html">insight list</a>.
