	<H1>GraphQL Support Script</H1>

	The GraphQL Support script is responsible for two things:
	<ol>
		<li>Correctly representing the nodes for a GraphQL request in the sites tree (since ZAP 2.10.0).</li>
		<li>Adding GraphQL support for Active Scan Input Vectors.</li>
	</ol>

	The following sections will elaborate a little on each of these functionalities.

	<h2>Sites Tree Representation</h2>

	Each unique GraphQL request proxied through ZAP is represented in the sites tree. 
	Requests are placed under a common node if they have the same operations.
	Two queries that have the same fields will be represented by the same node.
	The only exception is when a query is sent with inline arguments and also using variables. 
	In this case, a prefix of either '0' or '1' is added to distinguish between them respectively.
	<br>
	For example, the following figure illustrates how two requests may be represented in the sites tree.

	<h2>Active Scan Input Vectors</h2>

	If Active Scan Script Input Vectors are enabled,
	values are injected for inline arguments in all queries proxied through ZAP. 
	If a query uses variables, then variables are replaced inline and variable definitions are deleted.
	<br>
	Note that the built-in JSON Input Vector handler also works when a request is sent as JSON.
