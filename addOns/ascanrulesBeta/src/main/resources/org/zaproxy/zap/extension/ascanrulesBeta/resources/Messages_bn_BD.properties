ascanbeta.HTTPParamPoll.desc = HTTP Parameter Pollution (HPP) attacks consist of injecting encoded query string delimiters into other existing parameters. If a web application does not properly sanitize the user input, a malicious user can compromise the logic of the application to perform either client-side or server-side attacks. One consequence of HPP attacks is that the attacker can potentially override existing hard-coded HTTP parameters to modify the behavior of an application, bypass input validation checkpoints, and access and possibly exploit variables that may be out of direct reach.

ascanbeta.insecurehttpmethod.desc = The insecure HTTP method [{0}] is enabled on the web server for this resource. Depending on the web server configuration, and the underlying implementation responsible for serving the resource, this might or might not be exploitable. The TRACK and TRACE methods may be used by an attacker, to gain access to the authorisation token/session cookie of an application user, even if the session cookie is protected using the ''HttpOnly'' flag. For the attack to be successful, the application user must typically be using an older web browser, or a web browser which has a Same Origin Policy (SOP) bypass vulnerability. The ''CONNECT'' method can be used by a web client to create an HTTP tunnel to third party websites or services.
ascanbeta.insecurehttpmethod.detailed.name = Insecure HTTP Method - {0}

ascanbeta.proxydisclosure.extrainfo.webserver.header = The following web/application server has been identified\: 
ascanbeta.proxydisclosure.name = Proxy Disclosure
ascanbeta.proxydisclosure.refs = https\://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231\#section-5.1.2
ascanbeta.proxydisclosure.soln = Disable the 'TRACE' method on the proxy servers, as well as the origin web/application server.\nDisable the 'OPTIONS' method on the proxy servers, as well as the origin web/application server, if it is not required for other purposes, such as 'CORS' (Cross Origin Resource Sharing).\nConfigure the web and application servers with custom error pages, to prevent 'fingerprintable' product-specific error pages being leaked to the user in the event of HTTP errors, such as 'TRACK' requests for non-existent pages.\nConfigure all proxies, application servers, and web servers to prevent disclosure of the technology and version information in the 'Server' and 'X-Powered-By' HTTP response headers.\n

ascanbeta.relativepathconfusion.desc = The web server is configured to serve responses to ambiguous URLs in a manner that is likely to lead to confusion about the correct "relative path" for the URL. Resources (CSS, images, etc.) are also specified in the page response using relative, rather than absolute URLs. In an attack, if the web browser parses the "cross-content" response in a permissive manner, or can be tricked into permissively parsing the "cross-content" response, using techniques such as framing, then the web browser may be fooled into interpreting HTML as CSS (or other content types), leading to an XSS vulnerability.
ascanbeta.relativepathconfusion.extrainfo.contenttypeenabled = A Content Type of "{0}" was specified. If the web browser is employing strict parsing rules, this will prevent cross-content attacks from succeeding. Quirks Mode in the web browser would disable strict parsing.  
ascanbeta.relativepathconfusion.extrainfo.framingallowed = No X-Frame-Options header was specified, so the page can be framed, and this can be used to enable Quirks Mode, allowing the specified Content Type to be bypassed.
ascanbeta.relativepathconfusion.extrainfo.morethanonebasetag = More than one <base> tag was specified in the HTML <head> tag to define the location for relative URLs, which is not valid.
ascanbeta.relativepathconfusion.extrainfo.nobasetag = No <base> tag was specified in the HTML <head> tag to define the location for relative URLs.
ascanbeta.relativepathconfusion.extrainfo.nocontenttype = No Content Type was specified, so Quirks Mode is not required to exploit the vulnerability in the web browser. 
ascanbeta.relativepathconfusion.extrainfo.quirksmodeenabledexplicitly = Quirks Mode is explicitly enabled via <meta http-equiv\="{0}", allowing the specified Content Type to be bypassed.
ascanbeta.relativepathconfusion.extrainfo.quirksmodeenabledimplicitly = Quirks Mode is implicitly enabled via the use of an old DOCTYPE with PUBLIC id "{0}", allowing the specified Content Type to be bypassed in some web browsers.
ascanbeta.relativepathconfusion.extrainfo.quirksmodeenabledimplicitlynodoctype = Quirks Mode is implicitly enabled via the absence of a DOCTYPE, allowing the specified Content Type to be bypassed.
ascanbeta.relativepathconfusion.name = Relative Path Confusion
ascanbeta.relativepathconfusion.refs = https\://arxiv.org/abs/1811.00917\nhttps\://hsivonen.fi/doctype/\nhttps\://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_base.asp
ascanbeta.relativepathconfusion.soln = Web servers and frameworks should be updated to be configured to not serve responses to ambiguous URLs in such a way that the relative path of such URLs could be mis-interpreted by components on either the client side, or server side.\nWithin the application, the correct use of the "<base>" HTML tag in the HTTP response will unambiguously specify the base URL for all relative URLs in the document.\nUse the "Content-Type" HTTP response header to make it harder for the attacker to force the web browser to mis-interpret the content type of the response.\nUse the "X-Content-Type-Options\: nosniff" HTTP response header to prevent the web browser from "sniffing" the content type of the response.\nUse a modern DOCTYPE such as "<\!doctype html>" to prevent the page from being rendered in the web browser using "Quirks Mode", since this results in the content type being ignored by the web browser.\nSpecify the "X-Frame-Options" HTTP response header to prevent Quirks Mode from being enabled in the web browser using framing attacks. 

ascanbeta.sessionfixation.alert.attack = {0} field\: [{1}]

ascanbeta.sessionfixation.alert.cookie.extrainfo.loginpage = The url on which the issue was discovered was flagged as a logon page.\n\nThis issue should be manually validated by checking that the session token set on the logon page is still valid once logged in, and that the token can be used to directly access a page/resource which should require the user to be logged in.
ascanbeta.sessionfixation.alert.url.extrainfo = A likely session value has appeared in URLs in the HTML output when URL parameter/pseudo URL parameter [{0}] is set to NULL\: [{1}]\nWhen this ''borrowed'' session [{1}] is used in a subsequent request for this URL, a new session is not created.
ascanbeta.sessionfixation.alert.url.extrainfo.loginpage = The url on which the issue was discovered was flagged as a logon page.
ascanbeta.sessionfixation.desc = Session Fixation may be possible. If this issue occurs with a login URL (where the user authenticates themselves to the application), then the URL may be given by an attacker, along with a fixed session id, to a victim, in order to later assume the identity of the victim using the given session id. If the issue occurs with a non-login page, the URL and fixed session id may only be used by an attacker to track an unauthenticated user's actions. If the vulnerability occurs on a cookie field or a form field (POST parameter) rather than on a URL (GET) parameter, then some other vulnerability may also be required in order to set the cookie field on the victim's browser, to allow the vulnerability to be exploited.

ascanbeta.sessionfixation.soln = 1) Prevent the attacker from gaining a session id by enforcing strict session ids, and by only allocating session ids upon successful authentication to the application.\n2) The server should always create a new session id upon authentication, regardless of whether a session is already in place.\n3) Bind the session id to some identifiable client attribute combination, such as IP address, SSL client certificate.\n4) Sessions, when destroyed, must be destroyed on the server, as well as on the client.\n5) Implement a logout mechanism which will destroy all previous sessions for the client.\n6) Implement absolute session timeouts.\n7)Switch from a URL based to a cookie or form based session id implementation, as the latter typically require additional vulnerabilities, in order to be exploitable by an attacker\n

ascanbeta.sessionidaccessiblebyjavascript.alert.attack = {0} field\: [{1}]
ascanbeta.sessionidaccessiblebyjavascript.alert.extrainfo = session identifier {0} field [{1}], value [{2}] may be accessed using JavaScript in the web browser
ascanbeta.sessionidaccessiblebyjavascript.alert.extrainfo.loginpage = The url on which the issue was discovered was flagged as a logon page.
ascanbeta.sessionidaccessiblebyjavascript.desc = A Session Id cookie sent by the server (when the URL is modified by setting the named parameter field to NULL) may be accessed by JavaScript on the client. In conjunction with another vulnerability, this may allow the session to be hijacked.  
#Session Id Cookie accessible by JavaScript
ascanbeta.sessionidaccessiblebyjavascript.name = Session ID Cookie Accessible to JavaScript
#these refs cannot be referenced, but we leave it here in the hope that it can be in the future..
ascanbeta.sessionidaccessiblebyjavascript.refs=
ascanbeta.sessionidaccessiblebyjavascript.soln = 1) Use the 'httponly' flag when setting a cookie containing a session id, to prevent it from being accessed by JavaScript in the web browser.  

ascanbeta.sessionidexpiry.alert.attack = {0} field\: [{1}]
ascanbeta.sessionidexpiry.alert.extrainfo = session identifier {0} field [{1}], value [{2}] may be accessed until [{3}] (since cookie was received at {4}), unless the session is destroyed.
ascanbeta.sessionidexpiry.alert.extrainfo.loginpage = The url on which the issue was discovered was flagged as a logon page.
ascanbeta.sessionidexpiry.browserclose = browser close
ascanbeta.sessionidexpiry.desc = A Session Id cookie sent by the server (when the URL is modified by setting the named parameter field to NULL) is set to be valid for an excessive period of time. This may be exploitable by an attacker if the user forgets to log out, if the logout functionality does not correctly destroy the session, or if the session id is compromised by some other means.     
#Session Id Cookie Expiry
ascanbeta.sessionidexpiry.name = Session ID Expiry Time/Max-Age is Excessive
#these refs cannot be referenced, but we leave it here in the hope that it can be in the future..
ascanbeta.sessionidexpiry.refs=
ascanbeta.sessionidexpiry.soln = 1) Use the 'Expire' or 'Max-Age' cookie directives when setting a cookie containing a session id, to prevent it from being available for prolonged periods of time.\n2) Ensure that logout functionality exists, and that it correctly destroys the session.\n3) Use other preventative measures to ensure that if a session id is compromised, it may not be exploited.
ascanbeta.sessionidexpiry.timeexpired = Expired
ascanbeta.sessionidexpiry.timelessthanonehour = Less than one hour
ascanbeta.sessionidexpiry.timemorethanoneday = More than one day
ascanbeta.sessionidexpiry.timemorethanonehour = More than one hour
ascanbeta.sessionidexpiry.timemorethanoneweek = More than one week

ascanbeta.sessionidexposedinurl.alert.attack = {0} field\: [{1}]
ascanbeta.sessionidexposedinurl.alert.extrainfo = {0} field [{1}] contains an exposed session identifier [{2}]
ascanbeta.sessionidexposedinurl.alert.extrainfo.loginpage = The url on which the issue was discovered was flagged as a logon page.
ascanbeta.sessionidexposedinurl.desc = A session id is exposed in the URL. By sharing such a website URL (containing the session id), a naive user may be inadvertently granting access to their data, compromising its confidentiality, integrity, and availability.  URLs containing the session identifier also appear in web browser bookmarks, web server log files, and proxy server log files. 
#Exposed Session Id messages
ascanbeta.sessionidexposedinurl.name = Exposed Session ID
#these refs cannot be referenced, but we leave it here in the hope that it can be in the future..
ascanbeta.sessionidexposedinurl.refs = https\://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/OWASP_Top_Ten_2017/Top_10-2017_A2-Broken_Authentication
ascanbeta.sessionidexposedinurl.soln = Use a more secure session management implementation, such as one that uses session cookies, which are not as easily shared inadvertently, and which do not typically appear in server log files or web browser bookmarks.

ascanbeta.sessionidsentinsecurely.alert.attack = {0} field\: [{1}]
ascanbeta.sessionidsentinsecurely.alert.extrainfo = session identifier {0} field [{1}], value [{2}] may be sent via an insecure mechanism.  
ascanbeta.sessionidsentinsecurely.alert.extrainfo.loginpage = The url on which the issue was discovered was flagged as a logon page.
ascanbeta.sessionidsentinsecurely.alert.extrainfo.secureflagnotset = The 'secure' flag was not set on the session cookie supplied by the server.
ascanbeta.sessionidsentinsecurely.desc = A session id may be sent via an insecure mechanism. In the case of a cookie sent in the request, this occurs when HTTP, rather than HTTPS, is used.  In the case of a cookie sent by the server in response (when the URL is modified by setting the named parameter field to NULL), the 'secure' flag is not set, allowing the cookie to be sent later via HTTP rather than via HTTPS. This may allow a passive eavesdropper on the network path to gain full access to the victim's session.  
#Session Id Cookie not sent securely
ascanbeta.sessionidsentinsecurely.name = Session ID Transmitted Insecurely
#these refs cannot be referenced, but we leave it here in the hope that it can be in the future..
ascanbeta.sessionidsentinsecurely.refs = https\://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/OWASP_Top_Ten_2017/Top_10-2017_A2-Broken_Authentication
ascanbeta.sessionidsentinsecurely.soln = 1) Use the latest available version of SSL/TLS (for HTTPS) for all pages where a session id is communicated between the browser and the web server.\n2) Do not allow the communication to be forced down to the unencrypted HTTP protocol.\n3) Use the 'secure' flag when setting a cookie containing a session id, to prevent its subsequent transmission by an insecure mechanism.\n4) Forward non-secure HTTP page requests to the secure HTTPS equivalent page.  

ascanbeta.shellshock.desc = The server is running a version of the Bash shell that allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code 
ascanbeta.shellshock.extrainfo = From CVE-2014-6271\: GNU Bash through 4.3 processes trailing strings after function definitions in the values of environment variables, which allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a crafted environment, as demonstrated by vectors involving the ForceCommand feature in OpenSSH sshd, the mod_cgi and mod_cgid modules in the Apache HTTP Server, scripts executed by unspecified DHCP clients, and other situations in which setting the environment occurs across a privilege boundary from Bash execution, aka "ShellShock." NOTE\: the original fix for this issue was incorrect; CVE-2014-7169 has been assigned to cover the vulnerability that is still present after the incorrect fix.
ascanbeta.shellshock.name = Remote Code Execution - Shell Shock
ascanbeta.shellshock.ref = https\://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2014-6271\nhttps\://www.troyhunt.com/everything-you-need-to-know-about2/
ascanbeta.shellshock.soln = Update Bash on the server to the latest version

ascanbeta.sourcecodedisclosure.gitbased.name = Source Code Disclosure - Git 
ascanbeta.sourcecodedisclosure.gitbased.soln = Ensure that Git metadata files are not deployed to the web server or application server
ascanbeta.sourcecodedisclosure.lfibased.extrainfo = The output for the source code filename [{0}] differs sufficiently from that of the random parameter [{1}], at [{2}%], compared to a threshold of [{3}%]
ascanbeta.sourcecodedisclosure.lfibased.name = Source Code Disclosure - File Inclusion
ascanbeta.sourcecodedisclosure.svnbased.extrainfo = The source code for [{0}] was found at [{1}]
ascanbeta.sourcecodedisclosure.svnbased.name = Source Code Disclosure - SVN
ascanbeta.sourcecodedisclosure.svnbased.soln = Ensure that SVN metadata files are not deployed to the web server or application server

ascanbeta.sourcecodedisclosurecve-2012-1823.desc = Some PHP versions, when configured to run using CGI, do not correctly handle query strings that lack an unescaped "\=" character, enabling PHP source code disclosure, and arbitrary code execution. In this case, the contents of the PHP file were served directly to the web browser. This output will typically contain PHP, although it may also contain straight HTML.
ascanbeta.sourcecodedisclosurecve-2012-1823.name = Source Code Disclosure - CVE-2012-1823
ascanbeta.sourcecodedisclosurecve-2012-1823.soln = Upgrade to the latest stable version of PHP, or use the Apache web server and the mod_rewrite module to filter out malicious requests using the "RewriteCond" and "RewriteRule" directives.

ascanbeta.ssrf.desc = The web server receives a remote address and retrieves the contents of this URL, but it does not sufficiently ensure that the request is being sent to the expected destination.
ascanbeta.ssrf.name = Server Side Request Forgery
ascanbeta.ssrf.otherinfo.canaryinbody = The canary token from the out-of-band service was found in the response body.
ascanbeta.ssrf.refs = https\://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Server_Side_Request_Forgery_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet.html
ascanbeta.ssrf.skipped = no Active Scan OAST service is selected.
ascanbeta.ssrf.soln = Do not accept remote addresses as request parameters, and if you must, ensure that they are validated against an allow-list of expected values.

ascanbeta.text4shell.desc = Apache Commons Text prior to 1.10.0 allows RCE when applied to untrusted input due to insecure interpolation defaults.Apache Commons Text performs variable interpolation, allowing properties to be dynamically evaluated and expanded.The application has been shown to initial contact with remote servers via variable interpolation and may well be vulnerable to Remote Code Execution (RCE).
ascanbeta.text4shell.name = Text4shell (CVE-2022-42889)
ascanbeta.text4shell.refs = https\://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-42889\nhttps\://securitylab.github.com/advisories/GHSL-2022-018_Apache_Commons_Text/
ascanbeta.text4shell.skipped = no Active Scan OAST service is selected.
ascanbeta.text4shell.soln = Upgrade Apache Commons Text prior to version 1.10.0 or newer.

ascanbeta.usernameenumeration.alert.attack = Manipulate [{0}] field\: [{1}] and monitor the output 
ascanbeta.usernameenumeration.alert.extrainfo = [{0}] parameter [{1}] leaks information on whether a user exists. The [{5}] differences in output, for the valid original username value [{2}], and invalid username value [{3}] are\:\n[{4}]
ascanbeta.usernameenumeration.desc = It may be possible to enumerate usernames, based on differing HTTP responses when valid and invalid usernames are provided. This would greatly increase the probability of success of password brute-forcing attacks against the system. Note that false positives may sometimes be minimised by increasing the 'Attack Strength' Option in ZAP.  Please manually check the 'Other Info' field to confirm if this is actually an issue. 
ascanbeta.usernameenumeration.name = Possible Username Enumeration
ascanbeta.usernameenumeration.refs = https\://owasp.org/www-project-web-security-testing-guide/v41/4-Web_Application_Security_Testing/03-Identity_Management_Testing/04-Testing_for_Account_Enumeration_and_Guessable_User_Account.html\nhttps\://dl.ifip.org/db/conf/sec/sec2011/FreilingS11.pdf\nhttps\://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/204.html
ascanbeta.usernameenumeration.soln = Do not divulge details of whether a username is valid or invalid. In particular, for unsuccessful login attempts, do not differentiate between an invalid user and an invalid password in the error message, page title, page contents, HTTP headers, or redirection logic.
