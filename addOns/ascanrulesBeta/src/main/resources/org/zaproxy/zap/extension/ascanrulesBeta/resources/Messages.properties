ascanbeta.cloudmetadata.name = Cloud Metadata Potentially Exposed
ascanbeta.cloudmetadata.desc = The Cloud Metadata Attack attempts to abuse a misconfigured NGINX server in order to access the instance metadata maintained by cloud service providers such as AWS, GCP and Azure.\n\
All of these providers provide metadata via an internal unroutable IP address '169.254.169.254' - this can be exposed by incorrectly configured NGINX servers and accessed by using this IP address in the Host header field.
ascanbeta.cloudmetadata.otherinfo = Based on the successful response status code cloud metadata may have been returned in the response. Check the response data to see if any cloud metadata has been returned.\n\
 The meta data returned can include information that would allow an attacker to completely compromise the system.
ascanbeta.cloudmetadata.refs = https://www.nginx.com/blog/trust-no-one-perils-of-trusting-user-input/
ascanbeta.cloudmetadata.soln = Do not trust any user data in NGINX configs. In this case it is probably the use of the $host variable which is set from the 'Host' header and can be controlled by an attacker.

ascanbeta.cookieslack.name = Cookie Slack Detector
ascanbeta.cookieslack.desc = Repeated GET requests: drop a different cookie each time, followed by normal request with all cookies to stabilize session, compare responses against original baseline GET. This can reveal areas where cookie based authentication/attributes are not actually enforced.
ascanbeta.cookieslack.otherinfo.intro = Cookies that don't have expected effects can reveal flaws in application logic. In the worst case, this can reveal where authentication via cookie token(s) is not actually enforced.\n
ascanbeta.cookieslack.session.warning = NOTE: Because of its name this cookie may be important, but dropping it appears to have no effect: [{0}] \n
ascanbeta.cookieslack.affect.response.yes = These cookies affected the response: 
ascanbeta.cookieslack.affect.response.no = These cookies did NOT affect the response: 
ascanbeta.cookieslack.session.destroyed = Dropping this cookie appears to have invalidated the session: [{0}] A follow-on request with all original cookies still had a different response than the original request. \n

You should only grant access to "*" (all domains) if you are certain that this service does not host any access-controlled, personalized, or private data.
ascanbeta.crossdomain.adobe.read.extrainfo = The web server permits malicious cross-domain data read requests originating from Flash/Silverlight components served from any third party domain, to this domain. If the victim user is logged into this service, the malicious read requests are processed using the privileges of the victim, and can result in data from this service being compromised by an unauthorised third party web site, via the victim's web browser. This is particularly likely to be an issue if a Cookie based session implementation is in use. 
ascanbeta.crossdomain.adobe.send.soln = Configure the crossdomain.xml file to restrict the list of domains that are allowed to make cross-domain send (but not necessarily read) requests to this web server, using <allow-http-request-headers-from domain="example.com" headers="Authorization,X-Blahh">. You should only grant access to "*" (all domains) if you are certain that this service is not vulnerable to Cross Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks.
ascanbeta.crossdomain.adobe.send.extrainfo = The web server permits malicious cross-domain data send (but not necessarily read) requests originating from Flash/Silverlight components served from any third party domain, to this domain. If the victim user is logged into this service, the malicious send requests are processed using the privileges of the victim, and can result in Cross Site Request Forgery (CSRF) type attacks, via the victim's web browser. This is particularly likely to be an issue if a Cookie based session implementation is in use.
ascanbeta.crossdomain.silverlight.name = Cross-Domain Misconfiguration - Silverlight
ascanbeta.crossdomain.silverlight.desc = Silverlight based cross-site request forgery may be possible, due to a misconfiguration on the web server.
ascanbeta.crossdomain.silverlight.soln = Configure the clientaccesspolicy.xml file to restrict the list of domains that are allowed to make cross-domain requests to this web server, using <domain uri="https://example.com" />. You should only grant access to "*" (all domains) if you are certain that this service does not host any access-controlled, personalized, or private data.
ascanbeta.crossdomain.silverlight.extrainfo = The web server permits malicious cross-domain requests originating from Silverlight components served from any third party domain, to this domain. If the victim user is logged into this service, the malicious requests are processed using the privileges of the victim, and can result in data from this service being compromised by an unauthorised third party web site, via the victim's web browsers. It can also result in Cross Site Request Forgery (CSRF) type attacks. This is particularly likely to be an issue if a Cookie based session implementation is in use.

ascanbeta.csrftoken.name=Anti-CSRF Tokens Check
ascanbeta.csrftoken.extrainfo.annotation = This is an informational alert as the form has a security annotation indicating that it does not need an anti-CSRF Token. This should be tested manually to ensure the annotation is correct.

ascanbeta.envfiles.name = .env Information Leak
ascanbeta.envfiles.desc = One or more .env files seems to have been located on the server. These files often expose infrastructure or administrative account credentials, API or APP keys, or other sensitive configuration information.

ascanbeta.envfiles.refs = https://www.google.com/search?q=db_password+filetype%3Aenv\nhttps://mobile.twitter.com/svblxyz/status/1045013939904532482
ascanbeta.envfiles.soln = Ensure the .env file is not accessible.

ascanbeta.getforpost.name=GET for POST
ascanbeta.getforpost.desc=A request that was originally observed as a POST was also accepted as a GET. This issue does not represent a security weakness unto itself, however, it may facilitate simplification of other attacks. For example if the original POST is subject to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), then this finding may indicate that a simplified (GET based) XSS may also be possible.
ascanbeta.getforpost.soln=Ensure that only POST is accepted where POST is expected.

ascanbeta.heartbleed.name=Heartbleed OpenSSL Vulnerability
ascanbeta.heartbleed.desc=The TLS implementation in OpenSSL 1.0.1 before 1.0.1g does not properly handle Heartbeat Extension packets, which allows remote attackers to obtain sensitive information from process memory via crafted packets that trigger a buffer over-read, potentially disclosing sensitive information.
ascanbeta.heartbleed.soln=Update to OpenSSL 1.0.1g or later. Re-issue HTTPS certificates. Change asymmetric private keys and shared secret keys, since these may have been compromised, with no evidence of compromise in the server log files.
ascanbeta.heartbleed.refs=http://cvedetails.com/cve-details.php?t=1&cve_id=CVE-2014-0160
ascanbeta.heartbleed.extrainfo=This issue was confirmed by exfiltrating data from the server, using {0}. This is unlikely to be a false positive.

ascanbeta.hidden.files.name = Hidden File Finder
ascanbeta.hidden.files.alert.name = Hidden File Found

ascanbeta.hidden.files.refs = https://blog.hboeck.de/archives/892-Introducing-Snallygaster-a-Tool-to-Scan-for-Secrets-on-Web-Servers.html
ascanbeta.hidden.files.soln = Consider whether or not the component is actually required in production, if it isn't then disable it. If it is then ensure access to it requires appropriate authentication and authorization, or limit exposure to internal systems or specific source IPs, etc.

ascanbeta.HTTPParamPoll.name = HTTP Parameter Pollution
ascanbeta.HTTPParamPoll.desc = HTTP Parameter Pollution (HPP) attacks consist of injecting encoded query string delimiters into other existing parameters. If a web application does not properly sanitize the user input, a malicious user can compromise the logic of the application to perform either client-side or server-side attacks. One consequence of HPP attacks is that the attacker can potentially override existing hard-coded HTTP parameters to modify the behavior of an application, bypass input validation checkpoints, and access and possibly exploit variables that may be out of direct reach.
ascanbeta.HTTPParamPoll.sol =  Properly sanitize the user input for parameter delimiters
ascanbeta.HTTPParamPoll.alert.attack = HTTP Parameter Pollution
ascanbeta.HTTPParamPoll.extrainfo = http://www.google.com/search?q=http+parameter+pollution

ascanbeta.httponlysite.otherinfo.urinotencoded = Redirection URI couldn't be encoded.

ascanbeta.httpoxy.name = Httpoxy - Proxy Header Misuse
ascanbeta.httpoxy.desc = The server initiated a proxied request via the proxy specified in the HTTP Proxy header of the request.\
Httpoxy typically affects code running in CGI or CGI like environments.\n\
This may allow attackers to:\n\
* Proxy the outgoing HTTP requests made by the web application\n\
* Direct the server to open outgoing connections to an address and port of their choosing or\n\
* Tie up server resources by forcing the vulnerable software to use a malicious proxy
ascanbeta.httpoxy.otherinfo = An outgoing message to {0} was proxied via the host and port that ZAP injected into the HTTP Proxy header.
ascanbeta.httpoxy.soln = The best immediate mitigation is to block Proxy request headers as early as possible, and before they hit your application.
ascanbeta.httpoxy.refs = https://httpoxy.org/

ascanbeta.httpsashttp.name = HTTPS Content Available via HTTP
ascanbeta.httpsashttp.desc = Content which was initially accessed via HTTPS (i.e.: using SSL/TLS encryption) is also accessible via HTTP (without encryption). 
ascanbeta.httpsashttp.soln = Ensure that your web server, application server, load balancer, etc. is configured to only serve such content via HTTPS. Consider implementing HTTP Strict Transport Security.

ascanbeta.insecurehttpmethod.name = Insecure HTTP Method
ascanbeta.insecurehttpmethod.detailed.name = Insecure HTTP Method - {0}
ascanbeta.insecurehttpmethod.potentiallyinsecure = response code {0} for potentially insecure HTTP METHOD
ascanbeta.insecurehttpmethod.insecure = response code {0} for insecure HTTP METHOD
ascanbeta.insecurehttpmethod.desc = The insecure HTTP method [{0}] is enabled on the web server for this resource. Depending on the web server configuration, and the underlying implementation responsible for serving the resource, this might or might not be exploitable. The TRACK and TRACE methods may be used by an attacker, to gain access to the authorisation token/session cookie of an application user, even if the session cookie is protected using the 'HttpOnly' flag. For the attack to be successful, the application user must typically be using an older web browser, or a web browser which has a Same Origin Policy (SOP) bypass vulnerability. The 'CONNECT' method can be used by a web client to create an HTTP tunnel to third party websites or services.
ascanbeta.insecurehttpmethod.trace.exploitable.desc = The insecure HTTP method [{0}] is enabled for this resource, and is exploitable. The TRACK and TRACE methods may be used by an attacker, to gain access to the authorisation token/session cookie of an application user, even if the session cookie is protected using the 'HttpOnly' flag. For the attack to be successful, the application user must typically be using an older web browser, or a web browser which has a Same Origin Policy (SOP) bypass vulnerability.
ascanbeta.insecurehttpmethod.trace.exploitable.extrainfo = A TRACE request was sent for this request, with a custom cookie value [{0}]. This cookie value was disclosed in the HTTP response, confirming the vulnerability.
ascanbeta.insecurehttpmethod.connect.exploitable.desc = The insecure HTTP method [{0}] is enabled for this resource, and is exploitable. It was found to be possible to establish a tunneled socket connection to a third party service, using this HTTP method.  This would allow the service to be used as an anonymous spam relay, or as a web proxy, bypassing network restrictions. It also allows it to be used to establish a tunneled VPN, effectively extending the network perimeter to include untrusted components. 
ascanbeta.insecurehttpmethod.extrainfo = The OPTIONS method disclosed the following enabled HTTP methods for this resource: [{0}]
ascanbeta.insecurehttpmethod.connect.exploitable.extrainfo = The CONNECT method was used to establish a socket connection to [{0}], via the web server.
ascanbeta.insecurehttpmethod.soln = Disable insecure methods such as TRACK, TRACE, and CONNECT on the web server, and ensure that the underlying service implementation does not support insecure methods.

ascanbeta.proxydisclosure.extrainfo.silentproxyserver.header=The following 'silent' proxy servers were identified. Due to their behaviour, it is not known at which point in the network topology these proxy servers reside:
ascanbeta.proxydisclosure.extrainfo.silentproxyserver= - {0}
ascanbeta.proxydisclosure.extrainfo.traceenabled=The 'TRACE' method is enabled on one or more of the proxy servers, or on the origin server. This method leaks all information submitted from the web browser and proxies back to the user agent. This may facilitate 'Cross Site Tracing' attacks. 

ascanbeta.relativepathconfusion.name=Relative Path Confusion
ascanbeta.relativepathconfusion.desc=The web server is configured to serve responses to ambiguous URLs in a manner that is likely to lead to confusion about the correct "relative path" for the URL. Resources (CSS, images, etc.) are also specified in the page response using relative, rather than absolute URLs. In an attack, if the web browser parses the "cross-content" response in a permissive manner, or can be tricked into permissively parsing the "cross-content" response, using techniques such as framing, then the web browser may be fooled into interpreting HTML as CSS (or other content types), leading to an XSS vulnerability.
ascanbeta.relativepathconfusion.soln=Web servers and frameworks should be updated to be configured to not serve responses to ambiguous URLs in such a way that the relative path of such URLs could be mis-interpreted by components on either the client side, or server side.\nWithin the application, the correct use of the "<base>" HTML tag in the HTTP response will unambiguously specify the base URL for all relative URLs in the document.\nUse the "Content-Type" HTTP response header to make it harder for the attacker to force the web browser to mis-interpret the content type of the response.\nUse the "X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff" HTTP response header to prevent the web browser from "sniffing" the content type of the response.\nUse a modern DOCTYPE such as "<!doctype html>" to prevent the page from being rendered in the web browser using "Quirks Mode", since this results in the content type being ignored by the web browser.\nSpecify the "X-Frame-Options" HTTP response header to prevent Quirks Mode from being enabled in the web browser using framing attacks. 
ascanbeta.relativepathconfusion.refs=http://www.thespanner.co.uk/2014/03/21/rpo/\nhttps://hsivonen.fi/doctype/\nhttp://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_base.asp
ascanbeta.relativepathconfusion.extrainfo.morethanonebasetag=More than one <base> tag was specified in the HTML <head> tag to define the location for relative URLs, which is not valid.
ascanbeta.relativepathconfusion.extrainfo.nobasetag=No <base> tag was specified in the HTML <head> tag to define the location for relative URLs.
ascanbeta.relativepathconfusion.extrainfo.contenttypeenabled=A Content Type of "{0}" was specified. If the web browser is employing strict parsing rules, this will prevent cross-content attacks from succeeding. Quirks Mode in the web browser would disable strict parsing.  
ascanbeta.relativepathconfusion.extrainfo.quirksmodeenabledexplicitly=Quirks Mode is explicitly enabled via <meta http-equiv="{0}", allowing the specified Content Type to be bypassed.
ascanbeta.relativepathconfusion.extrainfo.quirksmodeenabledimplicitly=Quirks Mode is implicitly enabled via the use of an old DOCTYPE with PUBLIC id "{0}", allowing the specified Content Type to be bypassed in some web browsers.
ascanbeta.relativepathconfusion.extrainfo.quirksmodeenabledimplicitlynodoctype=Quirks Mode is implicitly enabled via the absence of a DOCTYPE, allowing the specified Content Type to be bypassed.
ascanbeta.relativepathconfusion.extrainfo.nocontenttype=No Content Type was specified, so Quirks Mode is not required to exploit the vulnerability in the web browser. 
ascanbeta.relativepathconfusion.extrainfo.framingallowed=No X-Frame-Options header was specified, so the page can be framed, and this can be used to enable Quirks Mode, allowing the specified Content Type to be bypassed.

ascanbeta.remotecodeexecution.cve-2012-1823.name = Remote Code Execution - CVE-2012-1823
ascanbeta.remotecodeexecution.cve-2012-1823.desc = Some PHP versions, when configured to run using CGI, do not correctly handle query strings that lack an unescaped "=" character, enabling arbitrary code execution. In this case, an operating system command was caused to be executed on the web server, and the results were returned to the web browser. 
ascanbeta.remotecodeexecution.cve-2012-1823.soln = Upgrade to the latest stable version of PHP, or use the Apache web server and the mod_rewrite module to filter out malicious requests using the "RewriteCond" and "RewriteRule" directives.

ascanbeta.sessionfixation.name=Session Fixation
ascanbeta.sessionfixation.desc=Session Fixation may be possible. If this issue occurs with a login URL (where the user authenticates themselves to the application), then the URL may be given by an attacker, along with a fixed session id, to a victim, in order to later assume the identity of the victim using the given session id. If the issue occurs with a non-login page, the URL and fixed session id may only be used by an attacker to track an unauthenticated user's actions. If the vulnerability occurs on a cookie field or a form field (POST parameter) rather than on a URL (GET) parameter, then some other vulnerability may also be required in order to set the cookie field on the victim's browser, to allow the vulnerability to be exploited.
ascanbeta.sessionfixation.soln=1) Prevent the attacker from gaining a session id by enforcing strict session ids, and by only allocating session ids upon successful authentication to the application.\n2) The server should always create a new session id upon authentication, regardless of whether a session is already in place.\n3) Bind the session id to some identificable client attribute combination, such as IP address, SSL client certificate.\n4) Sessions, when destroyed, must be destroyed on the server, as well as on the client.\n5) Implement a logout mechanism which will destroy all previous sessions for the client.\n6) Implement absolute session timeouts.\n7)Switch from a URL based to a cookie or form based session id implementation, as the latter typically require additional vulnerabilities, in order to be exploitable by an attacker\n

#Session Id Cookie not sent securely
ascanbeta.sessionidsentinsecurely.name=Session ID Transmitted Insecurely
ascanbeta.sessionidsentinsecurely.desc=A session id may be sent via an insecure mechanism. In the case of a cookie sent in the request, this occurs when HTTP, rather than HTTPS, is used.  In the case of a cookie sent by the server in response (when the URL is modified by setting the named parameter field to NULL), the 'secure' flag is not set, allowing the cookie to be sent later via HTTP rather than via HTTPS.

ascanbeta.paddingoracle.name=Generic Padding Oracle
ascanbeta.paddingoracle.desc=By manipulating the padding on an encrypted string, an attacker is able to generate an error message that indicates a likely 'padding oracle' vulnerability. Such a vulnerability can affect any application or framework that uses encryption improperly, such as some versions of ASP.net, Java Server Faces, and Mono. An attacker may exploit this issue to decrypt data and recover encryption keys, potentially viewing and modifying confidential data. This rule should detect the MS10-070 padding oracle vulnerability in ASP.net if CustomErrors are enabled for that.

ascanbeta.elinjection.name = Expression Language Injection
ascanbeta.elinjection.desc = The software constructs all or part of an expression language (EL) statement in a Java Server Page (JSP) using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the intended EL statement before it is executed. In certain versions of Spring 3.0.5 and earlier, there was a vulnerability (CVE-2011-2730) in which Expression Language tags would be evaluated twice, which effectively exposed any application to EL injection. However, even for later versions, this weakness is still possible depending on configuration.
ascanbeta.elinjection.soln = Perform data validation best practice against untrusted input and to ensure that output encoding is applied when data arrives on the EL layer, so that no metacharacter is found by the interpreter within the user content before evaluation. The most obvious patterns to detect include ${ and #{, but it may be possible to encode or fragment this data.
