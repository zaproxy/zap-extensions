ascanbeta.cors.vuln.name=CORS Misconfiguration
ascanbeta.cors.vuln.desc=This CORS misconfiguration could allow an attacker to perform AJAX queries to the vulnerable website from a malicious page loaded by the victim's user agent.\nIn order to perform authenticated AJAX queries, the server must specify the header "Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true" and the "Access-Control-Allow-Origin" header must be set to null or the malicious page's domain. Even if this misconfiguration doesn't allow authenticated AJAX requests, unauthenticated sensitive content can still be accessed (e.g intranet websites).\nA malicious page can belong to a malicious website but also a trusted website with flaws (e.g XSS, support of HTTP without TLS allowing code injection through MITM, etc).
ascanbeta.cors.soln=If a web resource contains sensitive information, the origin should be properly specified in the Access-Control-Allow-Origin header. Only trusted websites needing this resource should be specified in this header, with the most secured protocol supported.

ascanbeta.insecurehttpmethod.insecure = response code {0} for insecure HTTP METHOD
ascanbeta.insecurehttpmethod.desc = The insecure HTTP method [{0}] is enabled on the web server for this resource. Depending on the web server configuration, and the underlying implementation responsible for serving the resource, this might or might not be exploitable. The TRACK and TRACE methods may be used by an attacker, to gain access to the authorisation token/session cookie of an application user, even if the session cookie is protected using the 'HttpOnly' flag. For the attack to be successful, the application user must typically be using an older web browser, or a web browser which has a Same Origin Policy (SOP) bypass vulnerability. The 'CONNECT' method can be used by a web client to create an HTTP tunnel to third party websites or services.
ascanbeta.insecurehttpmethod.trace.exploitable.desc = The insecure HTTP method [{0}] is enabled for this resource, and is exploitable. The TRACK and TRACE methods may be used by an attacker, to gain access to the authorisation token/session cookie of an application user, even if the session cookie is protected using the 'HttpOnly' flag.

ascanbeta.insecurehttpmethod.connect.exploitable.desc = The insecure HTTP method [{0}] is enabled for this resource, and is exploitable. It was found to be possible to establish a tunneled socket connection to a third party service, using this HTTP method.  This would allow the service to be used as an anonymous spam relay, or as a web proxy, bypassing network restrictions. It also allows it to be used to establish a tunneled VPN, effectively extending the network perimeter to include untrusted components. 
ascanbeta.insecurehttpmethod.extrainfo = The OPTIONS method disclosed the following enabled HTTP methods for this resource: [{0}]
ascanbeta.insecurehttpmethod.connect.exploitable.extrainfo = The CONNECT method was used to establish a socket connection to [{0}], via the web server.

ascanbeta.relativepathconfusion.name=Relative Path Confusion
ascanbeta.relativepathconfusion.desc=The web server is configured to serve responses to ambiguous URLs in a manner that is likely to lead to confusion about the correct "relative path" for the URL. Resources (CSS, images, etc.) are also specified in the page response using relative, rather than absolute URLs. In an attack, if the web browser parses the "cross-content" response in a permissive manner, or can be tricked into permissively parsing the "cross-content" response, using techniques such as framing, then the web browser may be fooled into interpreting HTML as CSS (or other content types), leading to an XSS vulnerability.
ascanbeta.relativepathconfusion.soln=Web servers and frameworks should be updated to be configured to not serve responses to ambiguous URLs in such a way that the relative path of such URLs could be mis-interpreted by components on either the client side, or server side.\nWithin the application, the correct use of the "<base>" HTML tag in the HTTP response will unambiguously specify the base URL for all relative URLs in the document.\nUse the "Content-Type" HTTP response header to make it harder for the attacker to force the web browser to mis-interpret the content type of the response.\nUse the "X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff" HTTP response header to prevent the web browser from "sniffing" the content type of the response.\nUse a modern DOCTYPE such as "<!doctype html>" to prevent the page from being rendered in the web browser using "Quirks Mode", since this results in the content type being ignored by the web browser.\nSpecify the "X-Frame-Options" HTTP response header to prevent Quirks Mode from being enabled in the web browser using framing attacks.

ascanbeta.relativepathconfusion.extrainfo.nobasetag=No <base> tag was specified in the HTML <head> tag to define the location for relative URLs.
ascanbeta.relativepathconfusion.extrainfo.contenttypeenabled=A Content Type of "{0}" was specified. If the web browser is employing strict parsing rules, this will prevent cross-content attacks from succeeding. Quirks Mode in the web browser would disable strict parsing.  
ascanbeta.relativepathconfusion.extrainfo.quirksmodeenabledexplicitly=Quirks Mode is explicitly enabled via <meta http-equiv="{0}", allowing the specified Content Type to be bypassed.

ascanbeta.relativepathconfusion.extrainfo.nocontenttype=No Content Type was specified, so Quirks Mode is not required to exploit the vulnerability in the web browser. 
ascanbeta.relativepathconfusion.extrainfo.framingallowed=No X-Frame-Options header was specified, so the page can be framed, and this can be used to enable Quirks Mode, allowing the specified Content Type to be bypassed.

ascanbeta.sessionfixation.name=Session Fixation
ascanbeta.sessionfixation.desc=Session Fixation may be possible. If this issue occurs with a login URL (where the user authenticates themselves to the application), then the URL may be given by an attacker, along with a fixed session id, to a victim, in order to later assume the identity of the victim using the given session id. If the issue occurs with a non-login page, the URL and fixed session id may only be used by an attacker to track an unauthenticated user's actions. If the vulnerability occurs on a cookie field or a form field (POST parameter) rather than on a URL (GET) parameter, then some other vulnerability may also be required in order to set the cookie field on the victim's browser, to allow the vulnerability to be exploited.
ascanbeta.sessionfixation.soln=1) Prevent the attacker from gaining a session id by enforcing strict session ids, and by only allocating session ids upon successful authentication to the application.\n2) The server should always create a new session id upon authentication, regardless of whether a session is already in place.\n3) Bind the session id to some identifiable client attribute combination, such as IP address, SSL client certificate.\n4) Sessions, when destroyed, must be destroyed on the server, as well as on the client.\n5) Implement a logout mechanism which will destroy all previous sessions for the client.\n6) Implement absolute session timeouts.\n7)Switch from a URL based to a cookie or form based session id implementation, as the latter typically require additional vulnerabilities, in order to be exploitable by an attacker\n

ascanbeta.sessionidsentinsecurely.desc=A session id may be sent via an insecure mechanism. In the case of a cookie sent in the request, this occurs when HTTP, rather than HTTPS, is used.  In the case of a cookie sent by the server in response (when the URL is modified by setting the named parameter field to NULL), the 'secure' flag is not set, allowing the cookie to be sent later via HTTP rather than via HTTPS. This may allow a passive eavesdropper on the network path to gain full access to the victim's session.  
ascanbeta.sessionidsentinsecurely.soln=1) Use the latest available version of SSL/TLS (for HTTPS) for all pages where a session id is communicated between the browser and the web server.\n2) Do not allow the communication to be forced down to the unencrypted HTTP protocol.\n3) Use the 'secure' flag when setting a cookie containing a session id, to prevent its subsequent transmission by an insecure mechanism.\n4) Forward non-secure HTTP page requests to the secure HTTPS equivalent page.

ascanbeta.sessionidexpiry.desc=A Session Id cookie sent by the server (when the URL is modified by setting the named parameter field to NULL) is set to be valid for an excessive period of time. This may be exploitable by an attacker if the user forgets to log out, if the logout functionality does not correctly destroy the session, or if the session id is compromised by some other means.     
ascanbeta.sessionidexpiry.soln=1) Use the 'Expire' or 'Max-Age' cookie directives when setting a cookie containing a session id, to prevent it from being available for prolonged periods of time.\n2) Ensure that logout functionality exists, and that it correctly destroys the session.\n3) Use other preventative measures to ensure that if a session id is compromised, it may not be exploited.

ascanbeta.usernameenumeration.name=Possible Username Enumeration
ascanbeta.usernameenumeration.desc=It may be possible to enumerate usernames, based on differing HTTP responses when valid and invalid usernames are provided. This would greatly increase the probability of success of password brute-forcing attacks against the system. Note that false positives may sometimes be minimised by increasing the 'Attack Strength' Option in ZAP.  Please manually check the 'Other Info' field to confirm if this is actually an issue. 
ascanbeta.usernameenumeration.soln=Do not divulge details of whether a username is valid or invalid. In particular, for unsuccessful login attempts, do not differentiate between an invalid user and an invalid password in the error message, page title, page contents, HTTP headers, or redirection logic.

ascanbeta.elinjection.name = Expression Language Injection
ascanbeta.elinjection.desc = The software constructs all or part of an expression language (EL) statement in a Java Server Page (JSP) using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the intended EL statement before it is executed. In certain versions of Spring 3.0.5 and earlier, there was a vulnerability (CVE-2011-2730) in which Expression Language tags would be evaluated twice, which effectively exposed any application to EL injection. However, even for later versions, this weakness is still possible depending on configuration.
ascanbeta.elinjection.soln = Perform data validation best practice against untrusted input and to ensure that output encoding is applied when data arrives on the EL layer, so that no metacharacter is found by the interpreter within the user content before evaluation. The most obvious patterns to detect include ${ and #{, but it may be possible to encode or fragment this data.
