<H1>Client Side Integration</H1>

This add-on adds the following features to ZAP.

<h2>Client Spider</h2>

This add-on adds a <a href="spider.html">Client Spider</a> which is designed to explore modern web apps more effectively.

<h2>Browser Extensions</h2>

This add-on adds a ZAP browser extension to both Firefox and Chrome when they are launched from ZAP.
<p>
The extensions stream significant browser based events back to ZAP, giving ZAP an insight into what is going on in the browser.
<p>
If you do not launch your browser(s) from ZAP then you can still install these extensions directly from the relevant stores:

<ul>
<li>Firefox <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/addon/zap-browser-extension">ZAP Browser Extension</a>
<li>Chrome <a href="https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/zap-by-checkmarx-browser/hkjompcghnoikggknlpadkiphjbffilc">ZAP Browser Extension</a>
</ul>

Note that you may need to configure the extensions via their options pages to update the host and API key.

<h2>Passive Scanning</h2>

This add-on provides a <a href="pscan.html">Passive Scanner</a> which passively scans all of the data received from the browser.

<h2>User Interface</h2>

The add-on adds 4 new tabs to ZAP:

<h3>Client Map</h3>

The Client Map is a hierarchical representation of the sites visited, and is similar in some ways to the Sites Tree.
It includes nodes which represent URLs and ones which represent browser based storage.
<p>
Unlike the Sites Tree it includes <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/URI_fragment">URI fragments</a> which ZAP cannot otherwise see.
This means that the Client Map looks very different to the Sites tree for modern web apps, and may give you a better understanding of the
client side structure of the sites.
<p>
The following icons are used for leaf nodes so that you can easily tell their status:

<table>
	<tr>
		<td><img src="images/node-standard.png" align="bottom" width="16" height="16" /></td>
		<td>A URL which will be present in both the Site Tree and the Client Map</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td><img src="images/node-fragment.png" align="bottom" width="16" height="16" /></td>
		<td>A URL which will only be present in Client Map as the URL contains a fragment</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td><img src="images/node-minus.png" align="bottom" width="16" height="16" /></td>
		<td>A URL which was found in the DOM but which has not been accessed yet</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td><img src="images/node-redirect.png" align="bottom" width="16" height="16" /></td>
		<td>A URL which redirects to another URL</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td><img src="images/node-content-loaded.png" align="bottom" width="16" height="16" /></td>
		<td>A URL which was loaded as content by the browser (e.g. JavaScript files) rather than as HTML</td>
	</tr>
</table>


<p>
Selecting a node that has been visited by ZAP will display details about that node in the Client Details tab.
<p>
The following context menu items are supported:

<h4>Copy URLs</h4>

Copies the URLs of the selected nodes into the clipboard, separated by newlines.

<h4>Delete</h4>

Deletes the selected nodes.

<h4>Open in Browser</h4>

Opens the selected node in the chosen browser.
This menu item is disabled if multiple nodes are selected.
If the URL contains a fragment then this will be passed to the browser.

<h4>Show in Sites Tree</h4>

Opens the selected node in the Sites Tree.
The message in the Sites Tree does not necessarily match the same message which created the Site Node.
This menu item is disabled if multiple nodes are selected or if the URL has not yet been visited.
If the URL contains a fragment then this will be ignored.

<h3>Client Details</h3>

The Client Details tab shows details about Client Map nodes.
<p>
The types of data displayed include:
<ul>
<li>Button: Buttons detected in the DOM 
<li>Cookies: Cookies set in the browser
<li>FORM: Forms detected in the DOM 
<li>Input: Input elements detected in the DOM 
<li>Link: Links detected in the DOM 
</ul>

The following context menu items are supported:

<h4>Copy HREFs</h4>

<h4>Copy IDs</h4>

Copies the IDs of the selected entries into the clipboard, separated by newlines.

<h4>Copy Texts</h4>

Copies the Texts of the selected entries into the clipboard, separated by newlines.

<h3>Client History</h3>

The Client History tab shows all of the client side events sent from the browser extension to ZAP.
<p>
In addition to the data displayed in the Client Details tab it also includes:

<ul>
<li>DOM Mutation: Browser <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MutationObserver">MutationObserver</a> event 
<li>Node Added: A DOM node added to the specified URL 
<li>Page Load: Browser <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/load_event">load</a> event 
<li>Page Unload: Browser <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/unload_event">unload</a> event 
</ul>

The following context menu items are supported:

<h4>Copy Node IDs</h4>

Copies the Node IDs of the selected entries into the clipboard, separated by newlines.

<h4>Copy Node Names</h4>

Copies the Node Names of the selected entries into the clipboard, separated by newlines.

<h4>Copy Source URLs</h4>

<h3>Client Spider</h3>

<h2>AJAX Spider Enhancement</h2>

be accessed by the spider.
