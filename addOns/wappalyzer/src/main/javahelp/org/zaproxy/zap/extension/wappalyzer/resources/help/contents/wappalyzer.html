<H1>Technology Detection Using Wappalyzer</H1>
<p>
The Technology Detection add-on uses the Wappalyzer rules to detect the technologies used by applications.<p>
It works in a very similar way to the Wappalyzer browser add-ons with the following exceptions:
<ul>
<li>It does not use the 'Global JavaScript variables' as these are difficult to test without a 'full' browser</li>
<li>It does not not show the confidence - this is still todo</li>
<li>It allows you to see the 'evidence' used to detect the technologies</li>
</ul>
<H2>The Technology Tab</H2>
This tab shows all of the detected technologies for the site selected.<br>
Right clicking on a technology will display a 'Show evidence' menu under which are all of the regexes used to detect it.<br>
Selecting a regex will switch to the 'Search' tab and search through the history for that regex. Note: If multiple rows are selected
the menu will not be displayed.
<p>
Beside the site selection drop down is an Export button which can be used to export a CSV (comma separated values) file based on the
table information currently being displayed. There is also a toggle button which allows users to easily Enable/Disable the Wappalyzer
passive scanner.
