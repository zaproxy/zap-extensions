# The Official Example PoC

This is a very simple example PoC that shows how you can call the ZAP API from web pages.

You should create a similar MD page for your PoC and update it as appropriate.

## Technology

* JavaScript

## Tool Chain

None - the JavaScript files were written by hand and require no processing.
They are copied into the right place when the add-on is built and deployed.

## Limitations

This PoC does not yet support receiving events from ZAP, which will be needed for things like a History table equivalent.
This will be added ASAP.

JavaScript is used as this is really just showing you how to access ZAP - TypeScript is preferred for PoCs.

HTML Frames are used for expediency as well, ideally PoCs should not use depreciated HTML elements.
