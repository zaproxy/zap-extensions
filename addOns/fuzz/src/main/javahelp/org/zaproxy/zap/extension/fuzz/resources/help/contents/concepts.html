<H1>Fuzzing</H1>
<p>
Fuzzing is a technique of submitting lots of invalid or unexpected data to a target.
</p>
<p>
ZAP allows you to fuzz any request still using:
<ul>
<li>A build in set of payloads</li>
<li>Payloads defined by optional add-ons</li>
<li>Custom scripts</li>
</ul>
</p>
To access the <a href="dialogue.html">Fuzzer dialog</a> you can either:
<ul>
<li>Right click a request in one of the ZAP tabs (such as the History or Sites) and select “Attack / Fuzz…”</li>
<li>Highlight a string in the Request tab, right click it and select “Fuzz…”</li>
<li>Select the “Tools / Fuzz…” menu item and then select the request you want to fuzz</li>
</ul>

<h3>Payload Generators</h3>
Payload Generators generate the raw attacks that the fuzzer submits to the target application.
<br><br>
They are managed via the <a href="payloads.html">Payloads dialog</a>

<h3>Payload Processors</h3>
Payload Processors can be used to change specific payloads before they are submitted.
<br><br>
They are managed via the <a href="processors.html">Payload Processors dialog</a>

<h3>Fuzz Location Processors</h3>
Fuzz Location Processors can be used to change all of the payloads before they are submitted.
<br><br>
They are managed via the <a href="locations.html">Location Processors dialog</a>

<h3>Message Processors</h3>
Message Processors can access and change the messages being fuzzed, control the fuzzing process and interact with the ZAP UI.
<br><br>
They are managed via the <a href="dialogue.html">Fuzzer dialog</a> 'Message Processors' tab.

<p>
This functionality is based on code from the OWASP JBroFuzz project and includes files from the fuzzdb project.<br/>
Note that some fuzzdb files have been left out as they cause common anti virus scanners to flag them as containing viruses.<br/>
You can replace them (and upgrade fuzzdb) by downloading the latest version of fuzzdb and expanding it in the 'fuzzers' library.
