<h1>Tabbed Output Panel</h1>

The Common Library add-on provides a tabbed output panel that replaces the default output panel in ZAP.
This allows other add-ons to optionally log messages under named tabs in the output panel.
If a name is not provided, messages are shown under the "General" tab and exceptions are shown under the "Errors" tab
by default.

<p>
While the Output tab itself can be detached, the tabs within the Output tab can also be detached if desired.
To detach a tab, right click on it and select "Move Tab to New Window" in the context menu that pops up.

<p>
Right-clicking within the body of a tab will display a context menu with relevant options such as Copy and Find.
All standard shortcuts (such as Ctrl/Cmd + A/C/F), should work as expected too.
