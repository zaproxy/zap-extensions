<h1>Aturan Pindai Pasif - Alfa</h1>

The following alpha status passive scan rules are included in this add-on:

<h2>An example passive scan rule which loads data from a file</h2>
This implements an example passive scan rule that loads strings from a file that the user can edit.<br>

<h2>Base64 Disclosure</h2>
<ul>
 <li><b>ASP.NET ViewState Disclosure:</b> An ASP.NET ViewState was disclosed by the application/web server</li>
 <li><b>ASP.NET ViewState Integrity:</b> The application does not use a Message Authentication Code (MAC) to protect the integrity of the ASP.NET ViewState, which can be tampered with by a malicious client</li>
 <li><b>Base64 Disclosure:</b> Base64 encoded data was disclosed by the application/web server</li>
</ul>
<strong>Note:</strong> At Low Threshold all occurrences within each response will be included.

<h2>Site Isolation Scan Rule</h2>
Spectre is a side-channel attack allowing an attacker to read data
from memory. One of the counter-measures is to prevent sensitive data
from entering the memory and to separate trusted and untrusted documents in
different browsing contexts. Three headers have been defined to enable that:
<ul>
 <li>Cross-Origin-Resource-Policy</li>
 <li>Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy</li>
 <li>Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy</li>
</ul>
The Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy (COEP) header <q>prevents a document from
 loading any non-same-origin resources which don't explicitly grant the document
 permission to be loaded.</q> (from
<a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zDlfvfTJ_9e8Jdc8ehuV4zMEu9ySMCiTGMS9y0GU92k/edit">COOP and COEP explained</a>).
<blockquote cite="https://resourcepolicy.fyi/">
 The Cross-Origin-Resource-Policy (CORP) header allows you
 to control the set of origins that are empowered to include
 a resource. It is a robust defense against attacks like Spectre,
 as it allows browsers to block a given response before it enters
 an attacker's process.
</blockquote>
For example, an attacker site can include an image tag with an attribute
src to an internal content. The browser will load the data. With a
side-channel attack, an attacker will be able to read it.

The Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy (COOP) header forces the browser to create
multiple browsing contexts to separate trusted and untrusted documents.

Site Isolation is complementary with Cross-Origin-Resource-Blocking, a
mechanism managed independently by the browser.
