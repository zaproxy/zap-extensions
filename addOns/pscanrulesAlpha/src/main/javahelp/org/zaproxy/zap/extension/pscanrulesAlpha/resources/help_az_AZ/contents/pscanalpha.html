<h2 id="id-10094">Base64 Disclosure</h2>
<ul>
 <li><b>ASP.NET ViewState Disclosure:</b> An ASP.NET ViewState was disclosed by the application/web server</li>
 <li><b>ASP.NET ViewState Integrity:</b> The application does not use a Message Authentication Code (MAC) to protect the integrity of the ASP.NET ViewState, which can be tampered with by a malicious client</li>
 <li><b>Base64 Disclosure:</b> Base64 encoded data was disclosed by the application/web server</li>
</ul>
<strong>Note:</strong> At Low Threshold all occurrences within each response will be included.

<h2 id="id-90005">Fetch Metadata Request Headers Scan Rule</h2>
Fetch Metadata Request headers are HTTP request headers that provide additional information about a request's origin.
This additional information helps the server to implement resource isolation policy, allowing external sites to request only
those resources that are intended for sharing, and that are used appropriately. This approach can help mitigate common
cross-site web vulnerabilities such as CSRF, Cross-site Script Inclusion, timing attacks, and cross-origin information leaks.
The Fetch Metadata Request headers are:
<ul>
 <li>Sec-Fetch-Site</li>
 <li>Sec-Fetch-Mode</li>
 <li>Sec-Fetch-Dest</li>
 <li>Sec-Fetch-User</li>
</ul>
(from <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Fetch_metadata_request_header">Fetch Metadata Headers</a>)

<p>
Sec-Fetch-Site indicates the relationship between a request initiator's origin and the origin of requested resource.
(from <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Sec-Fetch-Site">Sec-Fetch-Site</a>)

<p>
Sec-Fetch-Mode allows the server to distinguish between requests originating from a user navigating between HTML
pages and requests to load images and other resources.
(from <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Sec-Fetch-Mode">Sec-Fetch-Mode</a>)

<p>
Sec-Fetch-Dest indicates where and how the requested resource will be used.
(from <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Sec-Fetch-Dest">Sec-Fetch-Dest</a>)

<p>
Sec-Fetch-User is only sent for requests initiated by user activation.
(from <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Sec-Fetch-User">Sec-Fetch-User</a>)

<h2 id="id-110009">Full Path Disclosure Scan Rule</h2>
<p>A Full Path Disclosure vulnerability is where the path to the root of the application providing valuable information for attackers.
Examples of Full Path Disclosure Vulnerabilities are : /home/omg/htdocs/file/ or C:\Users\username\server\
</p>
<p>The attacker could use this path to steal credentials or other private information. For more information visit : <a href="https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/Full_Path_Disclosure">OWASP article.</a></p>
