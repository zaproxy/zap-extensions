<H1>Passive Scan Rules - Alpha</H1>
The following alpha quality passive scan rules are included in this add-on:

<H2>An example passive scan rule which loads data from a file</H2>
This implements an example passive scan rule that loads strings from a file that the user can edit.<br>
For more details see: http://zaproxy.blogspot.co.uk/2014/04/hacking-zap-3-passive-scan-rules.html

<H2>Base64 Disclosure</H2>
<ul>
 <li><b>ASP.NET ViewState Disclosure: </b>An ASP.NET ViewState was disclosed by the application/web server</li>
 <li><b>ASP.NET ViewState Integrity: </b>The application does not use a Message Authentication Code (MAC) to protect the integrity of the ASP.NET ViewState, which can be tampered with by a malicious client</li>
 <li><b>Base64 Disclosure: </b>Base64 encoded data was disclosed by the application/web server</li>
</ul>

<H2>Big Redirect Detected (Potential Sensitive Information Leak)</H2>
This check predicts the size of various redirect type responses and generates an alert if the response is greater than the predicted size. 
A large redirect response may indicate that although a redirect has taken place the page actually contained content (which may reveal sensitive information, PII, etc).

<H2>Content Cacheability</H2>
This scanner analyzes the cache control and pragma headers in HTTP traffic and resports on the cacheability of the requests from a RFC7234 point of view.
<p>
Alerts generated:
<ul>
 <li><b>Non-Storable Content</b></li>
 <li><b>Storable but Non-Cacheable Content</b></li>
 <li><b>Storable and Cacheable Content</b></li>
</ul>

<H2>Content Security Policy (CSP) Header Not Set</H2>
This checks HTML response headers for the presence of a Content Security Policy header.<br>
By default this rule checks for the presence of the "Content-Security-Policy" header, 
and at the Low threshold also checks for the "X-Content-Security-Policy" and "X-WebKit-CSP" headers.<br>
Redirects and non HTML responses are ignored except at the Low threshold.
<p>
If a "Content-Security-Policy-Report-Only" header is found on a response an INFO alert is raised. This may represent an enforcement effort 
that is actively being refined or developed, or one which is only partially implemented.

<H2>Cookie Poisoning</H2>
This check looks at user-supplied input in query string parameters and POST data to identify where cookie parameters might be controlled. This is called a cookie poisoning attack, and becomes exploitable when an attacker can manipulate the cookie in various ways. In some cases this will not be exploitable, however, allowing URL parameters to set cookie values is generally considered a bug.

<H2>Directory Browsing</H2>
Passively scan responses for signatures that are indicative that Directory Browsing is possible.

<H2>Example Passive Scanner: Denial of Service</H2>
This implements a very simple example passive scan rule.<br>
For more details see: http://zaproxy.blogspot.co.uk/2014/04/hacking-zap-3-passive-scan-rules.html

<H2>Feature Policy Header Not Set</H2>
This scanner checks the HTTP response headers (on HTML and JavaScript responses) for inclusion of a "Feature-Policy" header, 
and alerts if one is not found.<br>
Redirects are ignored except at the Low threshold.

<H2>Hash Disclosure</H2>
Passively scan for password hashes disclosed by the web server. <br>
Various formats are including, including some formats such as MD4, MD5, and SHA*, which are sometimes used for purposes other than to contain password hashes. 

<H2>Heartbleed OpenSSL Vulnerability (Indicative)</H2>
Passively scans for HTTP header responses that may indicate that the server is vulnerable to the critical HeartBleed OpenSSL vulnerability. 

<H2>HTTP Server Response Header Scanner</H2>
This checks response headers for the presence of a server header that contains version details.
At LOW Threshold will raise an alert based on presence of the header field whether or not a version string is detected.

<H2>HTTP to HTTPS Insecure Transition in Form Post</H2>
This check looks for insecure HTTP pages that host HTTPS forms. The issue is that an insecure HTTP page can easily be hijacked through MITM and the secure HTTPS form can be replaced or spoofed.

<H2>HTTPS to HTTP Insecure Transition in Form Post</H2>
This check identifies secure HTTPS pages that host insecure HTTP forms. The issue is that a secure page is transitioning to an insecure page when data is uploaded through a form. The user may think they're submitting data to a secure page when in fact they are not.

<H2>In Page Banner Information Leak</H2>
Analyzes response body content for the presence of web or application server banners (when the responses have error status codes).<br>
If the Threshold is Low then status 200 - Ok responses are analyzed as well.<br>
The presence of such banners may facilitate more targeted attacks against known vulnerabilities.

<H2>Insecure Component</H2>
Passively scans the server response headers and body generator content for product versions, which are then cross-referenced against a list of product versions known to be vulnerable to various CVEs. 
A list of ranked CVEs and CVSS severity scores is output for each product noted to be vulnerable. 
Currently, the following server side products are supported:<br>
Apache Tomcat application server (limited functionality due to limited information leakage by Tomcat)<br>

<H2>Java Serialization Object</H2>
Java Serialization Object (JSO) is a way to save and exchange objects between Java applications.<br>
Different problems are associated with JSO. Sensitive data can leak to the stream of bytes.<br>
An attacker can also modify the data and exploit JSO to do a Remote Code Execution on the server.<br>
JSO should not be used by Java programs. Strong controls must be done on serialized data.<br>
JSO are a type of vulnerabilities associated to A8:2017-Insecure Deserialization.

<H2>Modern Web Application</H2>
This raises an informational alert if a site appears to be a modern web application.<br>
It does not indicate any potential vulnerabilities but it could indicate that the ajax spider might be more effective at exploring this site compared to the traditional spider.

<H2>Open Redirect</H2>
Open redirects are one of the OWASP 2010 Top Ten vulnerabilities. This check looks at user-supplied input in query string parameters and POST data to identify where open redirects might be possible. Open redirects occur when an application allows user-supplied input (e.g. http://nottrusted.com) to control an offsite redirect. This is generally a pretty accurate way to find where 301 or 302 redirects could be exploited by spammers or phishing attacks.

<H2>PII Disclosure scanner</H2>
PII is information like credit card number, SSN etc. This check currently reports only numbers which match credit card numbers and pass Luhn checksum, which gives high confidence, that this is a credit card number.

<H2>Retrieved from Cache</H2>
This scanner detect content that has been served from a shared cache.

<H2>Reverse Tabnabbing</H2>
This checks to see if any links use a target attribute without using both of the "noopener" and "noreferrer" keywords in the "rel" attribute, as this will allow target pages to take over the page that opens them.<br>
By default this rule will ignore all links that are in the same context as the page. At the LOW threshold it will only ignore links that are on the same host.<br>
At HIGH threshold it will only report links that use the "_blank" target.<br>
You can specify a comma separated list of URL regex patterns using the <code>rules.domains.trusted</code> parameter via the Options 'Rule configuration' panel.
Any link URL that matches one of these patterns will be considered to be in a trusted domain and will therefore not be reported.

<H2>Source Code Disclosure</H2>
Application Source Code was disclosed by the web server

<H2>Strict Transport Security Header Scanner</H2>
This scanner checks HTTPS responses for the presence of a HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) header and tests for various implementation concerns, 
alerting if they're found.

Alerts generated:
<ul>
 <li><b>Strict-Transport-Security Header Not Set: </b> If the response is HTTPS and the header is completely missing.</li>
 <li><b>Strict-Transport-Security Disabled: </b> If the response is HTTPS and the max-age value is set to zero, thus resetting the browser's HSTS information for the site.</li>
 <li><b>Strict-Transport-Security Multiple Header Entries (Non-compliant with Spec): </b> If the response is HTTPS and there is more than one HSTS header on the response.</li>
 <li><b>Strict-Transport-Security Missing Max-Age (Non-compliant with Spec): </b> If the response is HTTPS, a HSTS header is specified but the max-age value does not contain a number.</li>
 <li><b>Strict-Transport-Security Defined via META (Non-compliant with Spec): </b> If the response body includes a META tag which attempts to define HSTS.</li>
 <li><b>Strict-Transport-Security Header on Plain HTTP Response: </b> If the response is HTTP and the HSTS header is present.</li>
 <li><b>Strict-Transport-Security Max-Age Malformed (Non-compliant with Spec): </b> If the response is HTTPS and the HSTS header is present, but there are quotes preceding the max-age directive (quotes are allowed around the max-age value, but not around the directive itself).</li>
 <li><b>Strict-Transport-Security Malformed Content (Non-compliant with Spec): </b> If the response is HTTPS and a HSTS header is present, but there is some unexpected content (such as curly quotes). The expectation is that the content be printable ASCII.</li>
</ul>

Redirects to HTTPS URLs on the same domain will only be reported at Low threshold.

<H2>Sub Resource Integrity Attribute Missing</H2>
This scanner checks whether the integrity attribute in the script or the link element served by an external resource (for example: CDN) is missing.<br>
It helps mitigate an attack where the CDN has been compromised and content has been replaced by malicious content.<br>

<H2>User Controllable Charset</H2>
This check looks at user-supplied input in query string parameters and POST data to identify where Content-Type or meta tag charset declarations might be user-controlled. Such charset declarations should always be declared by the application. If an attacker can control the response charset, they could manipulate the HTML to perform XSS or other attacks.

<H2>User Controllable HTML Element Attribute (Potential XSS)</H2>
This check looks at user-supplied input in query string parameters and POST data to identify where certain HTML attribute values might be controlled. This provides hot-spot detection for XSS (cross-site scripting) that will require further review by a security analyst to determine exploitability.

<H2>User Controllable Javascript Event (XSS)</H2>
This check looks at user-supplied input in query string parameters and POST data to identify where certain HTML attribute values might be controlled. This provides hot-spot detection for XSS (cross-site scripting) that will require further review by a security analyst to determine exploitability.            

<H2>X-Backend-Server Header Information Leak</H2>
This checks response headers for the presence of X-Backend-Server details.

<H2>X-ChromeLogger-Data Header Information Leak</H2>
This checks response headers for the presence of X-ChromeLogger-Data or X-ChromePhp-Data details.
