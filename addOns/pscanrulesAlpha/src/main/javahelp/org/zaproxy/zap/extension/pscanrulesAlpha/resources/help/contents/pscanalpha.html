<H1>Passive Scan Rules - Alpha</H1>
The following alpha quality passive scan rules are included in this add-on:

<H2>An example passive scan rule which loads data from a file</H2>
This implements an example passive scan rule that loads strings from a file that the user can edit.<br>

<H2>Base64 Disclosure</H2>
<ul>
 <li><b>ASP.NET ViewState Disclosure: </b>An ASP.NET ViewState was disclosed by the application/web server</li>
 <li><b>ASP.NET ViewState Integrity: </b>The application does not use a Message Authentication Code (MAC) to protect the integrity of the ASP.NET ViewState, which can be tampered with by a malicious client</li>
 <li><b>Base64 Disclosure: </b>Base64 encoded data was disclosed by the application/web server</li>
</ul>

<H2>Content Cacheability</H2>
This scanner analyzes the cache control and pragma headers in HTTP traffic and resports on the cacheability of the requests from a RFC7234 point of view.
<p>
Alerts generated:
<ul>
 <li><b>Non-Storable Content</b></li>
 <li><b>Storable but Non-Cacheable Content</b></li>
 <li><b>Storable and Cacheable Content</b></li>
</ul>

<H2>Example Passive Scanner: Denial of Service</H2>
This implements a very simple example passive scan rule.<br>

<H2>Feature Policy Header Not Set</H2>
This scanner checks the HTTP response headers (on HTML and JavaScript responses) for inclusion of a "Feature-Policy" header, 
and alerts if one is not found.<br>
Redirects are ignored except at the Low threshold.
<p>

<H2>In Page Banner Information Leak</H2>
Analyzes response body content for the presence of web or application server banners (when the responses have error status codes).<br>
If the Threshold is Low then status 200 - Ok responses are analyzed as well.<br>
The presence of such banners may facilitate more targeted attacks against known vulnerabilities.

<H2>Insecure Component</H2>
Passively scans the server response headers and body generator content for product versions, which are then cross-referenced against a list of product versions known to be vulnerable to various CVEs. 
A list of ranked CVEs and CVSS severity scores is output for each product noted to be vulnerable. 
Currently, the following server side products are supported:<br>
Apache Tomcat application server (limited functionality due to limited information leakage by Tomcat)<br>
Apache web server<br>
mod_auth_radius Apache module<br>
mod_fcgid Apache module<br>
mod_imap Apache module<br>
mod_jk Apache module<br>
mod_perl Apache module<br>
mod_python Apache module<br>
mod_ssl Apache module<br>
OpenSSL Apache module<br>
Perl Apache module<br>
Python Apache module<br>
IBM HTTP Server<br>
JBoss application server<br>
Jetty web server / application server<br>
LiteSpeed web server<br>
Lighttpd web server<br>
Microsoft IIS web server<br>
Netscape Enterprise web server<br>
Nginx web server<br>
OpenCMS<br>
Oracle Application Server<br>
Oracle Web Cache<br>
PHP<br>
Phusion_Passenger<br>
Squid proxy server<br>
Sun One web server<br>
Sun Java System Web Server<br>
TornadoServer web server<br>
WordPress<br>

<H2>Java Serialization Object</H2>
Java Serialization Object (JSO) is a way to save and exchange objects between Java applications.<br>
Different problems are associated with JSO. Sensitive data can leak to the stream of bytes.<br>
An attacker can also modify the data and exploit JSO to do a Remote Code Execution on the server.<br>
JSO should not be used by Java programs. Strong controls must be done on serialized data.<br>
JSO are a type of vulnerabilities associated to A8:2017-Insecure Deserialization.

<H2>Modern Web Application</H2>
This raises an informational alert if a site appears to be a modern web application.<br>
It does not indicate any potential vulnerabilities but it could indicate that the ajax spider might be more effective at exploring this site compared to the traditional spider.

<H2>Source Code Disclosure</H2>
Application Source Code was disclosed by the web server

<H2>Sub Resource Integrity Attribute Missing</H2>
This scanner checks whether the integrity attribute in the script or the link element served by an external resource (for example: CDN) is missing.<br>
It helps mitigate an attack where the CDN has been compromised and content has been replaced by malicious content.<br>
