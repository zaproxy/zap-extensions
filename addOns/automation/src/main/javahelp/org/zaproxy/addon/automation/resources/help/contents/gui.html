<H1>Automation Framework - GUI</H1>

The Automation Framework has a GUI that is in the process of being developed.

<H2>Automation Tab</H2>

This tab allows you to create, load, edit and run automation jobs.
<p>
A toolbar provides the following buttons:

<ul>
<li>New Plan... - this launches the New Plan dialog
<li>Load Plan... - this allows you to load a plan from a yaml file
<li>Save Plan - this saves the current plan to a yaml file
<li>Run Plan - this runs the current plan
<li>Stop Plan - this stops the current plan
<li>Add Job... - this launches the Add Job dialog to add a job to the current plan
<li>Remove Job... - this removes the selected job from the current plan
<li>Move Job Up - this moves the selected job up one place in the current plan
<li>Move Job Down - this moves the selected job down one place in the current plan
<li>Add Test... - this launches the Add Test dialog to add a test to the current job
<li>Remove Test... - this removes the selected test from the current job
</ul>

Below the toolbar, you can find a graphical representation of the plan
which also shows the state of the plan when it is run.<br>
You can edit any of the elements of the plan by double clicking on them.
<p>
You can also change the following general job options via the plan table:

<ul>
<li>Enabled - only jobs that are enabled will run.
<li>Always Run - enabled jobs with this option will run even if the plan exits early.
</ul>

<H2>Output</H2>

Any output generated while loading or running the plan will
appear in the Automation sub-tab of the Output tab.

<H2>Future Plans</H2>

Future versions of this add-on will add:
<ul>
<li>Support for multiple plans
<li>Creating the plan from the current config
</ul>
