<H1>Automation Framework - activeScan Job</H1>

This job runs the active scanner. This actively attacks your applications and should therefore only be used against applications that you have permission to test.
<p>
By default this job will actively scan the first context defined in the <a href="environment.html">environment</a> and so none of the parameters are mandatory.
<p>
This job supports <a href="test-monitor.html">monitor</a> tests.

<H2>Job Data</H2>
The following class will be made available to add-ons that provide access to the Job Data such as the Reporting add-on.
Note that in this case the data is from the last Active Scan, regardless of whether it was started by the Automation Framework, the UI, or the API.
<ul>
<li>Key: <code>activeScanData</code>
<li>Class: <a href="https://github.com/zaproxy/zap-extensions/blob/main/addOns/automation/src/main/java/org/zaproxy/addon/automation/jobs/ActiveScanJobResultData.java">ActiveScanJobResultData</a>
