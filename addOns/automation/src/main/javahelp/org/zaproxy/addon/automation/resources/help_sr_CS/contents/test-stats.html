<H1>Automation Framework - Statistics Job Test</H1>

Statistics-based tests are supported by all add-ons that have an automation job. If there is a relevant
statistic used by an add-on, a test can be created for it.<br>
An up to date list of the statistics ZAP maintains can be found at 
<a href="https://www.zaproxy.org/docs/internal-statistics/">https://www.zaproxy.org/docs/internal-statistics/</a>.
<p>
A job can have tests for multiple statistics and multiple tests can be created for the same statistic.
<p>
Note that statistics-based tests will function correctly only if in memory statistics have been 
<a href="https://www.zaproxy.org/docs/desktop/ui/dialogs/options/stats/#in-memory-statistics-enabled">enabled</a>.
