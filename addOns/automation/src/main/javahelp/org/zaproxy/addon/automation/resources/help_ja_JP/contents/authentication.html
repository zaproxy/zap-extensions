<H1>Automation Framework - authentication</H1>
The Automation Framework supports a subset of the authentication mechanisms supported by ZAP.

<H2>Environmental Variables</H2>

ZAP supports a set of Authentication Header Environmental Variables - these will be applied by ZAP if they are defined
however ZAP is run, including via the Automation Framework.
<p>
These environmental variables must be defined at the system level - if they are defined in the <a href="environment.html">environment</a> 
env section then they will be ignored.

<H2>Context Based Authentication</H2>

The Automation Framework supports the following methods of authentication supported by ZAP:

<ul>
<li>Manual (use this if you are using the Authentication Header Environmental Variable)</li>
<li>HTTP / NTLM</li>
</ul>

The remaining mechanisms will be supported soon.

<H2>Authentication Statistics</H2>

ZAP maintains authentication statistics - search for 'auth' in the key field on the 
<a href="https://www.zaproxy.org/docs/internal-statistics/">ZAP Internal Statistics</a> website page.
These are ideal to use in <a href="tests.html">tests</a> to make sure the authentication is working as you expect. 
<p>
The authentication statistics are maintained for all supported authentication methods (including 'manual')
but only if you have configured all of the authentication elements correctly.<br>
You are strongly advised to test this via the ZAP desktop GUI.

<H2>Configuring Authentication</H2>

The recommended way to configure authentication is to do so via the ZAP desktop GUI - 
this gives you complete control over all aspects and allows you to test it in place.<br>
Then you can create a new Authentication Framework job using the context(s) you have tested - 
the authentication elements will be correctly initialised for all aspects supported.
<p>
It is worth noting that the authentication elements cannot be edited via the Automation Framework <a href="gui.html">GUI</a>,
but they will not get lost if you use the GUI as long as you do not use it to delete the contexts.
<p>
The GUI will be updated to support all of the authentication elements in due course.
