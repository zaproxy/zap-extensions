<H1>Automation Framework - Alert Job Test</H1>

Alert tests are supported by the activeScan and passiveScan-wait jobs. These tests can be used to validate the
presence/absence of specific alerts in the active/passive scan. It is mandatory for the alerts specified in the 
plan to have a scanRuleId, against which the generated alerts will always be matched. All other fields describing
an alert are optional regexes, and will be matched against only if they are specified.
<p>
A job can have tests for multiple alerts, and multiple tests can be created for alerts having the same scanRuleId.
