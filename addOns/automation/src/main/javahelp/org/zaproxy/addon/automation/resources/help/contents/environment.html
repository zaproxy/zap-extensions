<H1>Automation Framework - Environment</H1>

This section of the YAML configuration file defines the applications which the rest of the jobs can act on.
<p>
The environment is covered in the video: <a href="https://youtu.be/1fcpU54N-mA">ZAP Chat 08 Automation Framework Part 2 - Environment</a>.
<p>
The Automation Framework supports all of the <a href="authentication.html">authentication</a> mechanisms supported by ZAP.
<p>
<strong>Note</strong> When testing targets that operate on default ports (80 for http, 443 for https), the colon port portion of the URL should not be included.
Including that portion (for example: http://example.com:80) may result in an inability to crawl or test the target. If a 'default' port is specified both 
browsers and ZAP treat it without the default port being included then it doesn't match the expectation within the Context and there's nothing to interact with 
as part of the Context.

<h3>Variables</h3>

Variables can be defined in the 'vars' section.
They can be hardcoded, refer to other variables or refer to system environment variables in the same way as above, e.g. '${envvar}'. 
In case there are two variables with the same name, the value of the system variable would be preferred. 
  
<h3>Format Changes</h3>

Originally the 'engine' and 'scriptEngine' fields were directly under the 'sessionManagement' element - this is still supported when reading plans but they
will now always be output under the 'parameters' element.
<p>
Originally the 'username' and 'password' fields were directly under the user element - this is still supported when reading plans but they
will now always be output under the 'credentials' element.
<p>
When specifying technology the tech names are given on https://www.zaproxy.org/techtags/ - only specify the last name, e.g. "C".
