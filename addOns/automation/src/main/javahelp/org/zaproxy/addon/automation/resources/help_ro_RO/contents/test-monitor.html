<H1>Automation Framework - Monitor Job Test</H1>

Monitor tests are supported by long running jobs, such as <a href="job-ascan.html">activeScan</a> and
<a href="job-spider.html">spider</a>. 
<p>
Unlike the other Job Tests, monitor tests run while a job is running.
They work in a similar way to <a href="test-stats.html">statistic</a> tests in that they check a specified statistic,
but there is no 'operator' - instead the test will fail if the value of the statistic exceeds the given threshold.
<p>
Monitor tests can be used to terminate a long running job early, for example if there are too many authentication failures.
<p>
An up to date list of the statistics ZAP maintains can be found at 
<a href="https://www.zaproxy.org/docs/internal-statistics/">https://www.zaproxy.org/docs/internal-statistics/</a>.
<p>
A job can have tests for multiple statistics and multiple tests can be created for the same statistic.
<p>
Note that monitor tests will function correctly only if in memory statistics have been 
<a href="https://www.zaproxy.org/docs/desktop/ui/dialogs/options/stats/#in-memory-statistics-enabled">enabled</a>.
