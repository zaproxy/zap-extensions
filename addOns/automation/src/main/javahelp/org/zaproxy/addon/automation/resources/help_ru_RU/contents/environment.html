Этот раздел файла конфигурации YAML определяет приложения, с которыми могут работать остальные задания. 
<p>
The environment is covered in the video: <a href="https://youtu.be/1fcpU54N-mA">ZAP Chat 08 Automation Framework Part 2 - Environment</a>.
<p>
The Automation Framework supports all of the <a href="authentication.html">authentication</a> mechanisms supported by ZAP.
<p>
<strong>Note</strong> When testing targets that operate on default ports (80 for http, 443 for https), the colon port portion of the URL should not be included.
Including that portion (for example: http://example.com:80) may result in an inability to crawl or test the target. If a 'default' port is specified both 
browsers and ZAP treat it without the default port being included then it doesn't match the expectation within the Context and there's nothing to interact with 
as part of the Context.

<h3>Variables</h3>

Variables can be defined in the 'vars' section.
They can be hardcoded, refer to other variables or refer to system environment variables in the same way as above, e.g. '${envvar}'. 
In case there are two variables with the same name, the value of the system variable would be preferred. 

<h3>Configs</h3>

The 'configs' section can be used to define any value that can be set in the ZAP configuration file, which works in the same way as the ZAP '-config' command line option.
<p>
The advantages of using this section instead of the command line are:
<ol>
<li>The configuration will be self contained in the plan
<li>The ZAP team will monitor the keys used in this way (when telemetry is enabled) and prioritise adding full support for the most frequently used ones
<li>Warnings will be raised when a key being used has a better solution available
</ol>

No validation is performed on the keys and values, so you are responsible for checking that your configuration
is correct. Invalid keys will be silently ignored.
<p>
The recommended way to determine the keys is documented in the FAQ:
<a href="https://www.zaproxy.org/faq/how-do-you-find-out-what-key-to-use-to-set-a-config-value-on-the-command-line/">How do you find out what key to use to set a config value on the command line?</a>
<p>
A working example, which sets the number of passive scan threads, is:
<pre>
configs:
  pscans.threads: 8
</pre> 

<h3>Format Changes</h3>

Originally the 'engine' and 'scriptEngine' fields were directly under the 'sessionManagement' element - this is still supported when reading plans but they
will now always be output under the 'parameters' element.
<p>
Originally the 'username' and 'password' fields were directly under the user element - this is still supported when reading plans but they
will now always be output under the 'credentials' element.
<p>
When specifying technology the tech names are given on https://www.zaproxy.org/techtags/ - only specify the last name, e.g. "C".
