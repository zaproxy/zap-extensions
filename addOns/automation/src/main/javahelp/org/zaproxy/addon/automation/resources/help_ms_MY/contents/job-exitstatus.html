<H1>Automation Framework - exitStatus Job</H1>

This job sets <a href="automation.html#exit-codes">ZAP's exit code</a> based on scan results.
It also allows you to choose which exit values are used.
It should typically be the last job in a plan.
<p>
If warnLevel or errorLevel are set then the job will report a warning or error if any alerts
are raised which have the same risk level or greater.
<p>
By default when ZAP is run with the <code>-cmd</code> and <code>-autorun</code> options then it will
exit with a 1 if there are any errors, with a 2 if there are any warnings, and if everything is ok
then it will exit with a 0.
These values can be overriden by the <code>*ExitValue</code> options. The <code>*ExitValues</code> can be used together 
with the warn/errorLevel or completely independently of them.
