<H1>Automation Framework - Environment</H1>

This section of the YAML configuration file defines the applications which the rest of the jobs can act on.
<p>
The Automation Framework supports all of the <a href="authentication.html">authentication</a> mechanisms supported by ZAP.

    progressToStdout: true             # If set will write job progress to stdout
</pre>

System environment variables can also be used in the config in the same manner as above. In case there are two variables
with the same name, the value of the system variable would be preferred. 
  
<h3>Format Changes</h3>

Originally the 'engine' and 'scriptEngine' fields were directly under the 'sessionManagement' element - this is still supported when reading plans but they
will now always be output under the 'parameters' element.
<p>
Originally the 'username' and 'password' fields were directly under the user element - this is still supported when reading plans but they
will now always be output under the 'credentials' element.
