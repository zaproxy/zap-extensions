<H1>Automation Framework - URL Presence Job Test</H1>

URL Presence tests are supported by all the jobs. These tests can be used to validate the presence/absence of a URL and it's 
specific expressions in the HTTP response/request. The expressions are specified in the YAML file as regular expressions. 
The test will pass if the URL or the specified expression is found in the response/request depending upon the operator 
selection.
<p>
A job can have tests for multiple expressions, and multiple tests can be created for expressions having the same URL.
