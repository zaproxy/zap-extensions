<h1>OAST Tab</h1>

<p>This tab shows a summary of the out-of-band messages discovered by ZAP.</p>

<h2>Messages</h2>

For each message, you can see:

<table>
    <tr>
        <td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>
        <td>An Id</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>
        <td>The Timestamp of the received request.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>
        <td>The Method associated with the request (GET, POST, etc.)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>
        <td>The URL</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>
        <td>The Handler - The component which caught or responded to the callback request.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>
        <td>The Source - The address of the original request sender.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>
        <td>The Referer - The value of the HTTP <em>Referer</em> header (if one was included in the request).</td>
    </tr>
</table>

<h2>Buttons</h2>
<table>
    <tr>
        <td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>
        <td>Clear Messages</td>
        <td>Clears all messages in the table.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>
        <td>Poll Now</td>
        <td>Polls all registered services and resets the time to next polling. This means that if the polling
            frequency is set to 120 seconds, and you click on the button with 30 seconds remaining, the next automatic
            polling will occur after 120 seconds.
        </td>
    </tr>
</table>

<h2>Indicators</h2>
The OAST Tab contains status indicators for external OAST services. A grey colour indicates that the service has not
been registered yet. A green colour indicates that the service is registered and is being polled. If the service is
registered as an active scan service, a small flame icon is added to the bottom right corner of the indicator. The
timestamp next to the service name is updated whenever the service is polled.
