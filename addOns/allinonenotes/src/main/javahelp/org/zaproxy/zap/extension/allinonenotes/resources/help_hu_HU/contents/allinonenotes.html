<H1>All In One Notes</H1>
This is a simple add-on that allows you to see all your notes in a single pane, as well as export them. The "History" tab
allows you to add / edit notes to a particular request. This add-on gathers all notes into a single convenient view.

<p>
The add-on provides:

<H2>Status Panel</H2>
A basic status panel showing a table of notes and their corresponding request ID. Clicking on a row will automatically
take you to the corresponding request in the history tab. The panel also includes an "Export" button to export all notes
to a CSV file, and a "Reload" button to be able to reload the notes view more conveniently.
