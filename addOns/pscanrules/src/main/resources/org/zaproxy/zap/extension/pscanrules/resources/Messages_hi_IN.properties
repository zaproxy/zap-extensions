pscanrules.anticlickjacking.name = Anti-clickjacking Header
pscanrules.anticlickjacking.incInCsp = The Content-Security-Policy does include a 'frame-ancestors' element which takes precedence over the X-Frame-Options header, which is why this has been raised with a LOW risk.  
pscanrules.anticlickjacking.missing.name = Missing Anti-clickjacking Header
pscanrules.anticlickjacking.missing.desc = The response does not include either Content-Security-Policy with 'frame-ancestors' directive or X-Frame-Options to protect against 'ClickJacking' attacks.
pscanrules.anticlickjacking.missing.refs = https\://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/X-Frame-Options
pscanrules.anticlickjacking.missing.soln = Modern Web browsers support the Content-Security-Policy and X-Frame-Options HTTP headers. Ensure one of them is set on all web pages returned by your site/app.\nIf you expect the page to be framed only by pages on your server (e.g. it's part of a FRAMESET) then you'll want to use SAMEORIGIN, otherwise if you never expect the page to be framed, you should use DENY. Alternatively consider implementing Content Security Policy's "frame-ancestors" directive.
pscanrules.anticlickjacking.multiple.header.name = Multiple X-Frame-Options Header Entries
pscanrules.anticlickjacking.multiple.header.desc = X-Frame-Options (XFO) headers were found, a response with multiple XFO header entries may not be predictably treated by all user-agents.
pscanrules.anticlickjacking.multiple.header.refs = https\://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7034
pscanrules.anticlickjacking.multiple.header.soln = Ensure only a single X-Frame-Options header is present in the response.
pscanrules.anticlickjacking.compliance.meta.name = X-Frame-Options Defined via META (Non-compliant with Spec)
pscanrules.anticlickjacking.compliance.meta.desc = An X-Frame-Options (XFO) META tag was found, defining XFO via a META tag is explicitly not supported by the spec (RFC 7034).
pscanrules.anticlickjacking.compliance.meta.refs = https\://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7034\#section-4
pscanrules.anticlickjacking.compliance.meta.soln = Ensure X-Frame-Options is set via a response header field.  Alternatively consider implementing Content Security Policy's "frame-ancestors" directive.
pscanrules.anticlickjacking.compliance.malformed.setting.name = X-Frame-Options Setting Malformed
pscanrules.anticlickjacking.compliance.malformed.setting.desc = An X-Frame-Options header was present in the response but the value was not correctly set.
pscanrules.anticlickjacking.compliance.malformed.setting.refs = https\://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7034\#section-2.1
pscanrules.anticlickjacking.compliance.malformed.setting.soln = Ensure a valid setting is used on all web pages returned by your site (if you expect the page to be framed only by pages on your server (e.g. it's part of a FRAMESET) then you'll want to use SAMEORIGIN, otherwise if you never expect the page to be framed, you should use DENY.

pscanrules.authenticationcredentialscaptured.desc=An insecure authentication mechanism is in use. This allows an attacker on the network access to the userid and password of the authenticated user. For Basic Authentication, the attacker must merely monitor the network traffic until a Basic Authentication request is received, and then base64 decode the username and password.  For Digest Authentication, the attacker has access to the username, and possibly also the password, if the hash (including a nonce) can be successfully cracked, or if a Man-In-The-Middle attack is mounted.\nThe attacker eavesdrops on the network until an authentication has completed.
pscanrules.authenticationcredentialscaptured.soln=Use HTTPS, and use a secure authentication mechanism that does not transmit the userid or password in an un-encrypted fashion.  In particular, avoid use of the Basic Authentication mechanism, since this trivial obfuscation mechanism is easily broken.

When there's a charset mismatch between the HTTP header and content body Web browsers can be forced into an undesirable content-sniffing mode to determine the content's correct character set.\n\nAn attacker could manipulate content on the page to be interpreted in an encoding of their choice.

pscanrules.cookiesamesite.desc=A cookie has been set without the SameSite attribute, which means that the cookie can be sent as a result of a 'cross-site' request. \nThe SameSite attribute is an effective counter measure to cross-site request forgery, cross-site script inclusion, and timing attacks.
pscanrules.cookiesamesite.none.desc=A cookie has been set with its SameSite attribute set to "none", which means that the cookie can be sent as a result of a 'cross-site' request. \nThe SameSite attribute is an effective counter measure to cross-site request forgery, cross-site script inclusion, and timing attacks.

pscanrules.crossdomain.desc=Web browser data loading may be possible, due to a Cross Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) misconfiguration on the web server
pscanrules.crossdomain.soln=Ensure that sensitive data is not available in an unauthenticated manner (using IP address white-listing, for instance).\nConfigure the "Access-Control-Allow-Origin" HTTP header to a more restrictive set of domains, or remove all CORS headers entirely, to allow the web browser to enforce the Same Origin Policy (SOP) in a more restrictive manner.
pscanrules.crossdomain.refs=https\://vulncat.fortify.com/en/detail?id\=desc.config.dotnet.html5_overly_permissive_cors_policy
pscanrules.crossdomain.extrainfo=The CORS misconfiguration on the web server permits cross-domain read requests from arbitrary third party domains, using unauthenticated APIs on this domain. Web browser implementations do not permit arbitrary third parties to read the response from authenticated APIs, however. This reduces the risk somewhat. This misconfiguration could be used by an attacker to access data that is available in an unauthenticated manner, but which uses some other form of security, such as IP address white-listing.

pscanrules.cookielooselyscoped.name=Loosely Scoped Cookie
pscanrules.cookielooselyscoped.desc=Cookies can be scoped by domain or path. This check is only concerned with domain scope.The domain scope applied to a cookie determines which domains can access it. For example, a cookie can be scoped strictly to a subdomain e.g. www.nottrusted.com, or loosely scoped to a parent domain e.g. nottrusted.com. In the latter case, any subdomain of nottrusted.com can access the cookie. Loosely scoped cookies are common in mega-applications like google.com and live.com. Cookies set from a subdomain like app.foo.bar are transmitted only to that domain by the browser. However, cookies scoped to a parent-level domain may be transmitted to the parent, or any subdomain of the parent.
pscanrules.cookielooselyscoped.soln=Always scope cookies to a FQDN (Fully Qualified Domain Name).

CSP provides a set of standard HTTP headers that allow website owners to declare approved sources of content that browsers should be allowed to load on that page \u2014 covered types are JavaScript, CSS, HTML frames, fonts, images and embeddable objects such as Java applets, ActiveX, audio and video files.
