pscanrules.authenticationcredentialscaptured.alert.digestauth.extrainfo = [{0}] [{1}] uses insecure authentication mechanism [{2}], revealing username [{3}] and additional information [{4}].
pscanrules.authenticationcredentialscaptured.desc = An insecure authentication mechanism is in use. This allows an attacker on the network access to the userid and password of the authenticated user. For Basic Authentication, the attacker must merely monitor the network traffic until a Basic Authentication request is received, and then base64 decode the username and password.  For Digest Authentication, the attacker has access to the username, and possibly also the password, if the hash (including a nonce) can be successfully cracked, or if a Man-In-The-Middle attack is mounted.\nThe attacker eavesdrops on the network until an authentication has completed.
pscanrules.authenticationcredentialscaptured.name = Authentication Credentials Captured
pscanrules.authenticationcredentialscaptured.refs = https\://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/Brute_force_attack\nhttps\://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digest_access_authentication

pscanrules.charsetmismatch.desc = This check identifies responses where the HTTP Content-Type header declares a charset different from the charset defined by the body of the HTML or XML. When there's a charset mismatch between the HTTP header and content body Web browsers can be forced into an undesirable content-sniffing mode to determine the content's correct character set.\n\nAn attacker could manipulate content on the page to be interpreted in an encoding of their choice. For example, if an attacker can control content at the beginning of the page, they could inject script using UTF-7 encoded text and manipulate some browsers into interpreting that text.
pscanrules.charsetmismatch.extrainfo.html.header_metacharset_mismatch = There was a charset mismatch between the HTTP Header and the META charset encoding declaration\: [{0}] and [{1}] do not match.

pscanrules.cookielooselyscoped.desc = Cookies can be scoped by domain or path. This check is only concerned with domain scope.The domain scope applied to a cookie determines which domains can access it. For example, a cookie can be scoped strictly to a subdomain e.g. www.nottrusted.com, or loosely scoped to a parent domain e.g. nottrusted.com. In the latter case, any subdomain of nottrusted.com can access the cookie. Loosely scoped cookies are common in mega-applications like google.com and live.com. Cookies set from a subdomain like app.foo.bar are transmitted only to that domain by the browser. However, cookies scoped to a parent-level domain may be transmitted to the parent, or any subdomain of the parent.
pscanrules.cookielooselyscoped.extrainfo = The origin domain used for comparison was\: \n{0}\n{1}

pscanrules.crossdomain.desc = Web browser data loading may be possible, due to a Cross Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) misconfiguration on the web server
pscanrules.crossdomain.extrainfo = The CORS misconfiguration on the web server permits cross-domain read requests from arbitrary third party domains, using unauthenticated APIs on this domain. Web browser implementations do not permit arbitrary third parties to read the response from authenticated APIs, however. This reduces the risk somewhat. This misconfiguration could be used by an attacker to access data that is available in an unauthenticated manner, but which uses some other form of security, such as IP address white-listing.

pscanrules.usercontrolledcharset.desc = This check looks at user-supplied input in query string parameters and POST data to identify where Content-Type or meta tag charset declarations might be user-controlled. Such charset declarations should always be declared by the application. If an attacker can control the response charset, they could manipulate the HTML to perform XSS or other attacks. For example, an attacker controlling the <meta> element charset value is able to declare UTF-7 and is also able to include enough user-controlled payload early in the HTML document to have it interpreted as UTF-7. By encoding their payload with UTF-7 the attacker is able to bypass any server-side XSS protections and embed script in the page.
pscanrules.usercontrolledcharset.extrainfo = A(n) [{0}] tag [{1}] attribute\n\nThe user input found was\:\n{2}\={3}\n\nThe charset value it controlled was\:\n{4}
pscanrules.usercontrolledcharset.name = User Controllable Charset

pscanrules.usercontrolledcharset.soln = Force UTF-8 in all charset declarations. If user-input is required to decide a charset declaration, ensure that only an allowed list is used.

pscanrules.usercontrolledcookie.desc = This check looks at user-supplied input in query string parameters and POST data to identify where cookie parameters might be controlled. This is called a cookie poisoning attack, and becomes exploitable when an attacker can manipulate the cookie in various ways. In some cases this will not be exploitable, however, allowing URL parameters to set cookie values is generally considered a bug.
pscanrules.usercontrolledcookie.extrainfo = {0}This was identified at\:\n\n{1}\n\nUser-input was found in the following cookie\:\n{2}\n\nThe user input was\:\n{3}\={4}

pscanrules.usercontrolledopenredirect.desc = Open redirects are one of the OWASP 2010 Top Ten vulnerabilities. This check looks at user-supplied input in query string parameters and POST data to identify where open redirects might be possible. Open redirects occur when an application allows user-supplied input (e.g. https\://nottrusted.com) to control an offsite redirect. This is generally a pretty accurate way to find where 301 or 302 redirects could be exploited by spammers or phishing attacks.\n\nFor example an attacker could supply a user with the following link\: https\://example.com/example.php?url\=https\://malicious.example.com.
pscanrules.usercontrolledopenredirect.extrainfo.common = {0}\n\nThe user input found was\:\n\n{1}\={2}\n\nThe context was\:\n\n{3}
pscanrules.usercontrolledopenredirect.extrainfo.get = The 301 or 302 response to a request for the following URL appeared to contain user input in the location header\:\n\n
pscanrules.usercontrolledopenredirect.extrainfo.post = An open redirect controlled by POST parameters was detected. To test if this is a more serious issue, you should try resending that request as a GET, with the POST parameter included as a query string parameter. For example\: https\://nottrusted.com/page?url\=https\://lookout.net.\n\nThe 301 or 302 response to a request for the following URL appeared to contain user input in the location header\:\n\n

pscanrules.xchromeloggerdata.refs = https\://craig.is/writing/chrome-logger
pscanrules.xchromeloggerdata.soln = Disable this functionality in Production when it might leak information that could be leveraged by an attacker. Alternatively ensure that use of the functionality is tied to a strong authorization check and only available to administrators or support personnel for troubleshooting purposes not general users.

pscanrules.xcontenttypeoptions.desc = The Anti-MIME-Sniffing header X-Content-Type-Options was not set to 'nosniff'. This allows older versions of Internet Explorer and Chrome to perform MIME-sniffing on the response body, potentially causing the response body to be interpreted and displayed as a content type other than the declared content type. Current (early 2014) and legacy versions of Firefox will use the declared content type (if one is set), rather than performing MIME-sniffing.
pscanrules.xcontenttypeoptions.name = X-Content-Type-Options Header Missing
pscanrules.xcontenttypeoptions.otherinfo = This issue still applies to error type pages (401, 403, 500, etc.) as those pages are often still affected by injection issues, in which case there is still concern for browsers sniffing pages away from their actual content type.\nAt "High" threshold this scan rule will not alert on client or server error responses.
