When there's a charset mismatch between the HTTP header and content body Web browsers can be forced into an undesirable content-sniffing mode to determine the content's correct character set.\n\nAn attacker could manipulate content on the page to be interpreted in an encoding of their choice. For example, if an attacker can control content at the beginning of the page, they could inject script using UTF-7 encoded text and manipulate some browsers into interpreting that text.

Such charset declarations should always be declared by the application. If an attacker can control the response charset, they could manipulate the HTML to perform XSS or other attacks. For example, an attacker controlling the <meta> element charset value is able to declare UTF-7 and is also able to include enough user-controlled payload early in the HTML document to have it interpreted as UTF-7. By encoding their payload with UTF-7 the attacker is able to bypass any server-side XSS protections and embed script in the page.

pscanrules.usercontrolledcharset.soln = Force UTF-8 in all charset declarations. If user-input is required to decide a charset declaration, ensure that only an allowed list is used.

pscanrules.usercontrolledcookie.desc = This check looks at user-supplied input in query string parameters and POST data to identify where cookie parameters might be controlled. This is called a cookie poisoning attack, and becomes exploitable when an attacker can manipulate the cookie in various ways. In some cases this will not be exploitable, however, allowing URL parameters to set cookie values is generally considered a bug.
pscanrules.usercontrolledcookie.extrainfo = {0}This was identified at\:\n\n{1}\n\nUser-input was found in the following cookie\:\n{2}\n\nThe user input was\:\n{3}\={4}
pscanrules.usercontrolledcookie.extrainfo.get = An attacker may be able to poison cookie values through URL parameters.  Try injecting a semicolon to see if you can add cookie values (e.g. name\=controlledValue;name\=anotherValue;).\n\n
pscanrules.usercontrolledcookie.extrainfo.post = An attacker may be able to poison cookie values through POST parameters. To test if this is a more serious issue, you should try resending that request as a GET, with the POST parameter included as a query string parameter. For example\:  https\://nottrusted.com/page?value\=maliciousInput.\n\n
pscanrules.usercontrolledcookie.name = Cookie Poisoning
pscanrules.usercontrolledcookie.refs = https\://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_cookie\nhttps\://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/565.html
pscanrules.usercontrolledcookie.soln = Do not allow user input to control cookie names and values. If some query string parameters must be set in cookie values, be sure to filter out semicolon's that can serve as name/value pair delimiters.

pscanrules.usercontrolledhtmlattributes.desc = This check looks at user-supplied input in query string parameters and POST data to identify where certain HTML attribute values might be controlled. This provides hot-spot detection for XSS (cross-site scripting) that will require further review by a security analyst to determine exploitability.
pscanrules.usercontrolledhtmlattributes.extrainfo = User-controlled HTML attribute values were found. Try injecting special characters to see if XSS might be possible. The page at the following URL\:\n\n{0}\n\nappears to include user input in\: \n\na(n) [{1}] tag [{2}] attribute \n\nThe user input found was\:\n{3}\={4}\n\nThe user-controlled value was\:\n{5}
pscanrules.usercontrolledhtmlattributes.name = User Controllable HTML Element Attribute (Potential XSS)
pscanrules.usercontrolledhtmlattributes.refs = https\://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Input_Validation_Cheat_Sheet.html
pscanrules.usercontrolledhtmlattributes.soln = Validate all input and sanitize output it before writing to any HTML attributes.

pscanrules.usercontrolledjavascriptevent.desc = This check looks at user-supplied input in query string parameters and POST data to identify where certain HTML attribute values might be controlled. This provides hot-spot detection for XSS (cross-site scripting) that will require further review by a security analyst to determine exploitability.
pscanrules.usercontrolledjavascriptevent.extrainfo = User-controlled javascript event(s) was found. Exploitability will need to be manually determined. The page at the following URL\:\n\n{0}\n\nincludes the following Javascript event which may be attacker-controllable\: \n\nUser-input was found in the following data of an [{1}] event\:\n{2}\n\nThe user input was\:\n{3}
pscanrules.usercontrolledjavascriptevent.name = User Controllable JavaScript Event (XSS)
pscanrules.usercontrolledjavascriptevent.refs = https\://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Input_Validation_Cheat_Sheet.html
pscanrules.usercontrolledjavascriptevent.soln = Validate all input and sanitize output it before writing to any Javascript on* events.

pscanrules.usercontrolledopenredirect.desc = Open redirects are one of the OWASP 2010 Top Ten vulnerabilities. This check looks at user-supplied input in query string parameters and POST data to identify where open redirects might be possible. Open redirects occur when an application allows user-supplied input (e.g. https\://nottrusted.com) to control an offsite redirect. This is generally a pretty accurate way to find where 301 or 302 redirects could be exploited by spammers or phishing attacks.\n\nFor example an attacker could supply a user with the following link\: https\://example.com/example.php?url\=https\://malicious.example.com.
pscanrules.usercontrolledopenredirect.extrainfo.common = {0}\n\nThe user input found was\:\n\n{1}\={2}\n\nThe context was\:\n\n{3}
pscanrules.usercontrolledopenredirect.extrainfo.get = The 301 or 302 response to a request for the following URL appeared to contain user input in the location header\:\n\n
pscanrules.usercontrolledopenredirect.extrainfo.post = An open redirect controlled by POST parameters was detected. To test if this is a more serious issue, you should try resending that request as a GET, with the POST parameter included as a query string parameter. For example\: https\://nottrusted.com/page?url\=https\://lookout.net.\n\nThe 301 or 302 response to a request for the following URL appeared to contain user input in the location header\:\n\n
pscanrules.usercontrolledopenredirect.name = Open Redirect
pscanrules.usercontrolledopenredirect.refs = https\://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Unvalidated_Redirects_and_Forwards_Cheat_Sheet.html\nhttps\://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/601.html
pscanrules.usercontrolledopenredirect.soln = To avoid the open redirect vulnerability, parameters of the application script/program must be validated before sending 302 HTTP code (redirect) to the client browser. Implement safe redirect functionality that only redirects to relative URI's, or a list of trusted domains

pscanrules.xchromeloggerdata.soln = Disable this functionality in Production when it might leak information that could be leveraged by an attacker. Alternatively ensure that use of the functionality is tied to a strong authorization check and only available to administrators or support personnel for troubleshooting purposes not general users.

pscanrules.xcontenttypeoptions.desc = The Anti-MIME-Sniffing header X-Content-Type-Options was not set to 'nosniff'. This allows older versions of Internet Explorer and Chrome to perform MIME-sniffing on the response body, potentially causing the response body to be interpreted and displayed as a content type other than the declared content type. Current (early 2014) and legacy versions of Firefox will use the declared content type (if one is set), rather than performing MIME-sniffing.
pscanrules.xcontenttypeoptions.name = X-Content-Type-Options Header Missing
pscanrules.xcontenttypeoptions.otherinfo = This issue still applies to error type pages (401, 403, 500, etc.) as those pages are often still affected by injection issues, in which case there is still concern for browsers sniffing pages away from their actual content type.\nAt "High" threshold this scan rule will not alert on client or server error responses.

pscanrules.xcontenttypeoptions.soln = Ensure that the application/web server sets the Content-Type header appropriately, and that it sets the X-Content-Type-Options header to 'nosniff' for all web pages.\nIf possible, ensure that the end user uses a standards-compliant and modern web browser that does not perform MIME-sniffing at all, or that can be directed by the web application/web server to not perform MIME-sniffing.
