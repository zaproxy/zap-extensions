pscanrules.desc = Passive Scan Rules

pscanrules.authenticationcredentialscaptured.name=Authentication Credentials Captured
pscanrules.authenticationcredentialscaptured.desc=An insecure authentication mechanism is in use. This allows an attacker on the network access to the userid and password of the authenticated user. For Basic Authentication, the attacker must merely monitor the network traffic until a Basic Authentication request is received, and then base64 decode the username and password.  For Digest Authentication, the attacker has access to the username, and possibly also the password, if the hash (including a nonce) can be successfully cracked, or if a Man-In-The-Middle attack is mounted.\nThe attacker eavesdrops on the network until an authentication has completed.
pscanrules.authenticationcredentialscaptured.soln=Use HTTPS, and use a secure authentication mechanism that does not transmit the userid or password in an un-encrypted fashion.  In particular, avoid use of the Basic Authentication mechanism, since this trivial obfuscation mechanism is easily broken. 
pscanrules.authenticationcredentialscaptured.refs=https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Top_10_2010-A3\nhttps://www.owasp.org/index.php/Testing_for_Brute_Force_%28OWASP-AT-004%29\nhttps://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:Authentication_Vulnerability\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digest_access_authentication
pscanrules.authenticationcredentialscaptured.alert.basicauth.extrainfo=[{0}] [{1}] uses insecure authentication mechanism [{2}], revealing username [{3}] and password [{4}].
pscanrules.authenticationcredentialscaptured.alert.digestauth.extrainfo=[{0}] [{1}] uses insecure authentication mechanism [{2}], revealing username [{3}] and additional information [{4}].

pscanrules.charsetmismatch.variant.no_mismatch_metacontenttype_missing=(Meta Content-Type Charset Missing)
pscanrules.charsetmismatch.name=Charset Mismatch
pscanrules.charsetmismatch.variant.header_metacontentype_mismatch=(Header Versus Meta Content-Type Charset)
pscanrules.charsetmismatch.variant.header_metacharset_mismatch=(Header Versus Meta Charset)
pscanrules.charsetmismatch.variant.metacontenttype_metacharset_mismatch=(Meta Charset Versus Meta Content-Type Charset)
pscanrules.charsetmismatch.desc=This check identifies responses where the HTTP Content-Type header declares a charset different from the charset defined by the body of the HTML or XML. When there's a charset mismatch between the HTTP header and content body Web browsers can be forced into an undesirable content-sniffing mode to determine the content's correct character set.\n\nAn attacker could manipulate content on the page to be interpreted in an encoding of their choice. For example, if an attacker can control content at the beginning of the page, they could inject script using UTF-7 encoded text and manipulate some browsers into interpreting that text.
pscanrules.charsetmismatch.soln=Force UTF-8 for all text content in both the HTTP header and meta tags in HTML or encoding declarations in XML.
pscanrules.charsetmismatch.refs=http://code.google.com/p/browsersec/wiki/Part2#Character_set_handling_and_detection
pscanrules.charsetmismatch.extrainfo.html.no_mismatch_metacontenttype_missing=Charset is defined only by META charset, older clients that expect character set to be defined by META content-type may not correctly display this content.
pscanrules.charsetmismatch.extrainfo.html.header_metacontentype_mismatch=There was a charset mismatch between the HTTP Header and the META content-type encoding declarations: [{0}] and [{1}] do not match.
pscanrules.charsetmismatch.extrainfo.html.header_metacharset_mismatch=There was a charset mismatch between the HTTP Header and the META charset encoding declaration: [{0}] and [{1}] do not match.
pscanrules.charsetmismatch.extrainfo.html.metacontenttype_metacharset_mismatch=There was a charset mismatch between the META charset and the META content-type encoding declaration: [{0}] and [{1}] do not match.
pscanrules.charsetmismatch.extrainfo.xml=There was a charset mismatch between the HTTP Header and the XML encoding declaration: [{0}] and [{1}] do not match.

pscanrules.cookielooselyscoped.name=Loosely Scoped Cookie
pscanrules.cookielooselyscoped.desc=Cookies can be scoped by domain or path. This check is only concerned with domain scope.The domain scope applied to a cookie determines which domains can access it. For example, a cookie can be scoped strictly to a subdomain e.g. www.nottrusted.com, or loosely scoped to a parent domain e.g. nottrusted.com. In the latter case, any subdomain of nottrusted.com can access the cookie. Loosely scoped cookies are common in mega-applications like google.com and live.com. Cookies set from a subdomain like app.foo.bar are transmitted only to that domain by the browser. However, cookies scoped to a parent-level domain may be transmitted to the parent, or any subdomain of the parent.
pscanrules.cookielooselyscoped.soln=Always scope cookies to a FQDN (Fully Qualified Domain Name).
pscanrules.cookielooselyscoped.refs=https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6265#section-4.1\nhttps://www.owasp.org/index.php/Testing_for_cookies_attributes_(OTG-SESS-002)\nhttp://code.google.com/p/browsersec/wiki/Part2#Same-origin_policy_for_cookies
pscanrules.cookielooselyscoped.extrainfo=The origin domain used for comparison was: \r\n{0}\r\n{1}
pscanrules.cookielooselyscoped.extrainfo.cookie={0}\r\n

pscanrules.headerxssprotectionscanner.name = Web Browser XSS Protection Not Enabled
pscanrules.headerxssprotectionscanner.desc = Web Browser XSS Protection is not enabled, or is disabled by the configuration of the 'X-XSS-Protection' HTTP response header on the web server
pscanrules.headerxssprotectionscanner.refs = https://www.owasp.org/index.php/XSS_(Cross_Site_Scripting)_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet\nhttps://www.veracode.com/blog/2014/03/guidelines-for-setting-security-headers/
pscanrules.headerxssprotectionscanner.extrainfo = The X-XSS-Protection HTTP response header allows the web server to enable or disable the web browser's XSS protection mechanism. The following values would attempt to enable it: \nX-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block\nX-XSS-Protection: 1; report=http://www.example.com/xss\nThe following values would disable it:\nX-XSS-Protection: 0\nThe X-XSS-Protection HTTP response header is currently supported on Internet Explorer, Chrome and Safari (WebKit).\nNote that this alert is only raised if the response body could potentially contain an XSS payload (with a text-based content type, with a non-zero length).
pscanrules.headerxssprotectionscanner.soln = Ensure that the web browser's XSS filter is enabled, by setting the X-XSS-Protection HTTP response header to '1'.

pscanrules.informationdisclosuredebugerrors.name=Information Disclosure - Debug Error Messages

pscanrules.noanticsrftokens.name=Absence of Anti-CSRF Tokens
pscanrules.noanticsrftokens.desc=No Anti-CSRF tokens were found in a HTML submission form.
pscanrules.noanticsrftokens.alert.extrainfo=No known Anti-CSRF token {0} was found in the following HTML form: {1}.
pscanrules.noanticsrftokens.extrainfo.annotation=This is an informational alert as the form has a security annotation indicating that it does not need an anti-CSRF Token. This should be tested manually to ensure the annotation is correct.

pscanrules.xframeoptionsscanner.name = X-Frame-Options Header Scanner
pscanrules.xframeoptionsscanner.incInCsp = The Content-Security-Policy does include a 'frame-ancestors' element which takes precedence over the X-Frame-Options header, which is why this has been raised with a LOW risk.  
pscanrules.xframeoptionsscanner.missing.name = X-Frame-Options Header Not Set
pscanrules.xframeoptionsscanner.missing.desc = X-Frame-Options header is not included in the HTTP response to protect against 'ClickJacking' attacks.
pscanrules.xframeoptionsscanner.missing.refs = http://blogs.msdn.com/b/ieinternals/archive/2010/03/30/combating-clickjacking-with-x-frame-options.aspx
pscanrules.xframeoptionsscanner.missing.soln = Most modern Web browsers support the X-Frame-Options HTTP header. Ensure it's set on all web pages returned by your site (if you expect the page to be framed only by pages on your server (e.g. it's part of a FRAMESET) then you'll want to use SAMEORIGIN, otherwise if you never expect the page to be framed, you should use DENY. ALLOW-FROM allows specific websites to frame the web page in supported web browsers).
pscanrules.xframeoptionsscanner.multiple.header.name = Multiple X-Frame-Options Header Entries
pscanrules.xframeoptionsscanner.multiple.header.desc = X-Frame-Options (XFO) headers were found, a response with multiple XFO header entries may not be predictably treated by all user-agents.
pscanrules.xframeoptionsscanner.multiple.header.refs = https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7034
pscanrules.xframeoptionsscanner.multiple.header.soln = Ensure only a single X-Frame-Options header is present in the response.
pscanrules.xframeoptionsscanner.compliance.meta.name = X-Frame-Options Defined via META (Non-compliant with Spec)
pscanrules.xframeoptionsscanner.compliance.meta.desc = An X-Frame-Options (XFO) META tag was found, defining XFO via a META tag is explicitly not supported by the spec (RFC 7034).
pscanrules.xframeoptionsscanner.compliance.meta.refs = https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7034#section-4
pscanrules.xframeoptionsscanner.compliance.meta.soln = Ensure X-Frame-Options is set via a response header field.
pscanrules.xframeoptionsscanner.compliance.malformed.setting.name = X-Frame-Options Setting Malformed

pscanrules.xframeoptionsscanner.compliance.malformed.setting.refs = https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7034#section-2.1
pscanrules.xframeoptionsscanner.compliance.malformed.setting.soln = Ensure a valid setting is used on all web pages returned by your site (if you expect the page to be framed only by pages on your server (e.g. it's part of a FRAMESET) then you'll want to use SAMEORIGIN, otherwise if you never expect the page to be framed, you should use DENY. ALLOW-FROM allows specific websites to frame the web page in supported web browsers).

pscanrules.xcontenttypeoptionsscanner.name = X-Content-Type-Options Header Missing
pscanrules.xcontenttypeoptionsscanner.desc = The Anti-MIME-Sniffing header X-Content-Type-Options was not set to 'nosniff'. This allows older versions of Internet Explorer and Chrome to perform MIME-sniffing on the response body, potentially causing the response body to be interpreted and displayed as a content type other than the declared content type. Current (early 2014) and legacy versions of Firefox will use the declared content type (if one is set), rather than performing MIME-sniffing.
pscanrules.xcontenttypeoptionsscanner.otherinfo = This issue still applies to error type pages (401, 403, 500, etc) as those pages are often still affected by injection issues, in which case there is still concern for browsers sniffing pages away from their actual content type.\nAt "High" threshold this scanner will not alert on client or server error responses.
pscanrules.xcontenttypeoptionsscanner.refs = http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ie/gg622941%28v=vs.85%29.aspx\nhttps://www.owasp.org/index.php/List_of_useful_HTTP_headers
pscanrules.xcontenttypeoptionsscanner.soln = Ensure that the application/web server sets the Content-Type header appropriately, and that it sets the X-Content-Type-Options header to 'nosniff' for all web pages.\nIf possible, ensure that the end user uses a standards-compliant and modern web browser that does not perform MIME-sniffing at all, or that can be directed by the web application/web server to not perform MIME-sniffing.

pscanrules.applicationerrorscanner.name = Application Error Disclosure
pscanrules.applicationerrorscanner.desc = This page contains an error/warning message that may disclose sensitive information like the location of the file that produced the unhandled exception. This information can be used to launch further attacks against the web application. The alert could be a false positive if the error message is found inside a documentation page.
pscanrules.applicationerrorscanner.soln = Review the source code of this page. Implement custom error pages. Consider implementing a mechanism to provide a unique error reference/identifier to the client (browser) while logging the details on the server side and not exposing them to the user.

pscanrules.cachecontrolscanner.name = Incomplete or No Cache-control and Pragma HTTP Header Set
pscanrules.cachecontrolscanner.desc = The cache-control and pragma HTTP header have not been set properly or are missing allowing the browser and proxies to cache content.

pscanrules.cookiehttponlyscanner.name = Cookie No HttpOnly Flag
pscanrules.cookiehttponlyscanner.desc=A cookie has been set without the HttpOnly flag, which means that the cookie can be accessed by JavaScript. If a malicious script can be run on this page then the cookie will be accessible and can be transmitted to another site. If this is a session cookie then session hijacking may be possible.
pscanrules.cookiehttponlyscanner.soln=Ensure that the HttpOnly flag is set for all cookies.
pscanrules.cookiehttponlyscanner.refs=http://www.owasp.org/index.php/HttpOnly

pscanrules.cookiesecureflagscanner.name = Cookie Without Secure Flag
pscanrules.cookiesecureflagscanner.desc=A cookie has been set without the secure flag, which means that the cookie can be accessed via unencrypted connections.
pscanrules.cookiesecureflagscanner.soln=Whenever a cookie contains sensitive information or is a session token, then it should always be passed using an encrypted channel. Ensure that the secure flag is set for cookies containing such sensitive information.
