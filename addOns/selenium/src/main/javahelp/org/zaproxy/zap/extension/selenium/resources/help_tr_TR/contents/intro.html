	<h1>Selenyum</h1>

	<p>Selenyum eklentisi WebDrivers'ı diğer eklentiler için web tarayıcılarını çağırıp uzaktan kontrol etmeyi sağlar. Aynı zamanda, kafasız bir Java tabanlı web tarayıcısı olan HtmlUnit web tarayıcısı da paketlenmiştir.
		
	<p>It adds a 'Selenium' script type - these scripts are invoked whenever selenium launches a browser,
	for example for the Ajax Spider or for manual browsing. 
	
	<p>The add-on also adds a right click option to ZAP panels that list URLs (such as the History and Sites tree)
	which allows you to open the selected URL in any of the supported browsers. The Selenium scripts have access to the 
	launched browser and can interact with it, for example, run JavaScript scripts, access URLs, fill forms, click buttons...
	<br><strong>Note:</strong> The Selenium scripts are executed synchronously for the AJAX Spider, to prevent interferences
	with the crawler later, it's up to the scripts to access the required URLs.

	<h2>Supported Browsers</h2>

	
	<p>The following web browsers are supported:
	<table border="2">
		<tr>
			<th>Name</th>
			<th>ID</th>
			<th>Requirements/Notes</th>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Chrome</td>
			<td>chrome</td>
			<td>The following versions are known to work: 59 and 60 (older versions might work
				too). Requires ChromeDriver, if not on the system's PATH, it can be set in the
				options. For more information on ChromeDriver and how to obtain it refer to the <a
				href="https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/">ChromeDriver website</a>.
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Chrome Headless</td>
			<td>chrome-headless</td>
			<td>Starts Chrome without GUI.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Firefox</td>
			<td>firefox</td>
			<td>The following versions are known to work: 45 (ESR), 46, 47.0.1, 54, and 55 (older
				versions might work too). Some versions are known to not work, for example, 47.0. Newer
				versions (&ge; 48) require geckodriver, it can be set in the options. For more
				information on geckodriver and how to obtain it refer to the <a
				href="https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver">geckodriver website</a> (see footer note
				for caveat when using geckodriver).
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Firefox Headless</td>
			<td>firefox-headless</td>
			<td>Starts Firefox without GUI.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>HtmlUnit</td>
			<td>htmlunit</td>
			<td>Bundled browser, does not have any requirement.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Safari</td>
			<td>safari</td>
			<td>&nbsp;</td>
		</tr>
	</table>
	<p>To use Firefox, Chrome, and Safari, you must
		have them installed in your system. The ID of the browser can be used to choose the
		browser when configuring ZAP through the command line or using the ZAP API (for example,
		to set the AJAX Spider to use one or other browser).
	<p>
		Some of the requirements (e.g. WebDrivers) of the browsers can be configured in the <a
			href="options.html">Options Selenium screen</a>.

	<h2>Bundled WebDrivers</h2>
	ZAP provides add-ons with the WebDrivers, when those add-ons are installed ZAP will
	attempt to use those bundled WebDrivers by default. Some OSs might not have a WebDriver
	for some of the browsers, in those cases ZAP will inform, in the options panel, that
	there's no bundled WebDriver available. The bundled WebDrivers can also be (re)set with
	the 'Bundled' button (for example, if another WebDriver was manually set). Not all
	browser versions are supported with the bundled WebDrivers, it's recommended that
	newer/latest versions of the browsers be used whenever possible.

	<p>
		<strong>Note:</strong> ZAP add-ons can add additional browsers.
