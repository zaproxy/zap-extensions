	<h1>Selenium</h1>

	<p>O complemento Selenium fornece WebDrivers, para outros complementos, para invocar e controlar remotamente navegadores da web. Ele traz embutido o HtmlUnit, navegador web baseado em Java headless.
		
	<p>It adds a 'Selenium' script type - these scripts are invoked whenever selenium launches a browser,
	for example for the Ajax Spider or for manual browsing. 
	
	<p>The add-on also adds a right click option to ZAP panels that list URLs (such at the History and Sites tree)
	which allows you to open the selected URL in any of the supported browsers. The Selenium scripts have access to the 
	launched browser and can interact with it, for example, run JavaScript scripts, access URLs, fill forms, click buttons...
	<br><strong>Note:</strong> The Selenium scripts are executed synchronously for the AJAX Spider, to prevent interferences
	with the crawler later, it's up to the scripts to access the required URLs.

	<h2>Supported Browsers</h2>

	
	<p>The following web browsers are supported:

	<p>To use Firefox, Chrome, Opera, PhantomJS and Safari, you must
		have them installed in your system. The ID of the browser can be used to choose the
		browser when configuring ZAP through the command line or using the ZAP API (for example,
		to set the AJAX Spider to use one or other browser).
	<p>
		Some of the requirements (e.g. WebDrivers) of the browsers can be configured in the <a
			href="options.html">Options Selenium screen</a>.

	<h2>Bundled WebDrivers</h2>
	ZAP provides add-ons with the WebDrivers, when those add-ons are installed ZAP will
	attempt to use those bundled WebDrivers by default. Some OSs might not have a WebDriver
	for some of the browsers, in those cases ZAP will inform, in the options panel, that
	there's no bundled WebDriver available. The bundled WebDrivers can also be (re)set with
	the 'Bundled' button (for example, if another WebDriver was manually set). Not all
	browser versions are supported with the bundled WebDrivers, it's recommended that
	newer/latest versions of the browsers be used whenever possible.

	<p>
		<strong>Note:</strong> ZAP add-ons can add additional browsers.

	<p>
		<strong>Firefox/geckodriver Note:</strong> There's an issue (<a
			href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1103196">Bug 1103196</a>) that
		prevents HTTPS sites from being used in versions &ge; 48 and &lt; 52.
	<p>
		<strong>PhantomJS Note:</strong> There's an issue (<a
			href="https://github.com/ariya/phantomjs/issues/11342">Issue #11342</a>) that prevents
		sites at localhost, 127.0.0.1 and ::1 from being proxied through ZAP. Until a fix is
		available is advised to not use it in those cases. Some add-ons might choose to show
		warning message when that happens. As workaround one could define, in the <code>hosts</code>
		file, a domain name mapping to the local address and use that domain name instead.
