        <td>Action Spoofing
        <td>SOAP requests contain some sort of operation that is 
        later executed by the web application. This operation can be found 
        in the first child element of the SOAP Body. However, if HTTP is used 
        to transport the SOAP message the SOAP standard allows the use of an 
        additional HTTP header element called SOAPAction. This header element 
        contains the name of the executed operation. It is supposed to inform 
        the receiving web service of what operation is contained in the SOAP 
        Body, without having to do any XML parsing. This optimization can 
        be used by an attacker to mount an attack, since certain web service 
        frameworks determine the operation to be executed solely on the 
        information contained in the SOAPAction header field.

        <td>SOAP XML Injection
        <td>During an "XML Injection" an attacker tries to add or manipulate 
        various XML Tags in the SOAP message aiming to manipulate the XML 
        structure. Usually a successful XML injection results in the 
        execution of a restricted or unintended operation. Depending on the 
        executed operation various security or business controls might be 
        violated.
