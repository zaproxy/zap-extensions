<h1>SOAP Support</h1>
This add-on imports and scans WSDL files containing SOAP endpoints.
<br><br>
It also supports the <a href="automation.html">Automation Framework</a>.

<h2>Importing</h2>
The add-on will automatically detect any SOAP definitions and spider them as long as they are in scope.

2 menu items are also added to the Import menu:

<li>Import a WSDL file from local file system</li>
<li>Import a WSDL file from a URL</li>
</ul>
These operations are also available via the API.

<b>NOTE:</b> As of version 6 of this add-on, only encoded URLs are supported.

<h3>Form Handler Add-on Support</h3>
