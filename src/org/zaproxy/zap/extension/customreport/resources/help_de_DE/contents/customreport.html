<h1>Customizable HTML Report</h1>
The Customizable HTML Report add-on allows to control the information that goes into the ZAP scanning report.
It has three tabs to provide details about the report: Scope, Alerts and Alert Details.

<h2>Scope</h2>
Can set the report name, report description and select the template of the HTML output.  
Additionally, can specify whether to include only contents in scope. 
<br>
Report templates:
	<ul>
		<li><b>Traditional</b>: lists all the alerts and sorts them by the risk level from High to Low.</li>
		<li><b>Separated Sites</b>: same as Traditional, but also groups by domain names.</li>
		<li><b>Concise</b>: groups alerts by type (to avoid repetition) and sorts from High to Low.</li>
	</ul>
	
<h2>Alerts</h2>
Can select which alert types to include into the report. 
Additionally, alerts can be selected or unselected by risk level (Informational, Low, Medium and High).

<h2>Alert Details</h2>
Allows to select which alert attributes are included into the Report.
<br>
These are checked and are included by default:
	<ul>
		<li>Description</li>
		<li>Other Info</li>
		<li>Solution</li>
		<li>Reference</li>
		<li>CWE ID</li>
		<li>WASC ID</li>
	</ul>

These are unchecked and are excluded by default:
	<ul>
		<li>Request Header</li>
		<li>Response Header</li>
		<li>Request Body</li>
		<li>Response Body</li>
	</ul>
	
</body>
