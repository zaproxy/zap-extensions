Web backdoors from the wild, collected during incident response, submitted, and acquired otherwise.

Antivirus/antimalware bypass:
Most antivirus/antimalware/waf/ids/etc will flag on these immediately, deleting a payload that otherwise could have been successfully uploaded. Basic evasion techniques are likely to work. Try modifying the code so that it's different enough to not trigger pattern-based signatures. Examples - delete comments, replace function names, replace variable names.
