	<h1>Selenium</h1>

	<p>The Selenium add-on provides WebDrivers, for other add-ons, to invoke and remotely
		control web browsers. It's also bundled the HtmlUnit web browser, an headless Java based
		web browser.
	<p>The following web browsers are supported:
	<ul>
		<li>Chrome</li>
		<li>Firefox - the following versions are known to work: 45 (ESR), 46 and 47.0.1
			(older version might work too). Some versions are known to not work, for example, 47.0.
			Newer versions (&ge; 48) require geckodriver.</li>
		<li>HtmlUnit</li>
		<li>Internet Explorer</li>
		<li>Opera</li>
		<li>PhantomJS</li>
		<li>Safari</li>
	</ul>
	<p>To use Firefox, Chrome, Internet Explorer, Opera, PhantomJS and Safari, you must
		have them installed in your system.
	<p>
		Some of the web browsers require extra configurations, done in <a href="options.html">Options
			Selenium screen</a>, to access and control them:
	<ul>
		<li>Chrome - requires ChromeDriver, if not on the system's PATH, it can be set in
			the options. For more information on ChromeDriver and how to obtain it refer to the <a
			href="https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/">ChromeDriver website</a>.
		</li>
		<li>Firefox - requires geckodriver for versions &ge; 48, it can be set in the
			options. For more information on geckodriver and how to obtain it refer to the <a
			href="https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver">geckodriver website</a> (see footer note
			for caveat when using geckodriver).
		</li>
		<li>PhantomJS - requires PhantomJS binary, if not on the system's PATH, it can be
			set in the options. For more information on PhantomJS and how to obtain it refer to the
			<a href="http://phantomjs.org/">PhantomJS website</a> (see footer note for caveat when
			using PhantomJS).
		</li>
		<li>Internet Explorer - requires IEDriverServer, if not on the system's PATH, it
			can be set in the options. For more information on IEDriverServer refer to the <a
			href="https://code.google.com/p/selenium/wiki/InternetExplorerDriver">IEDriverServer
				website</a> (see footer note for caveat when using Internet Explorer).
		</li>
	</ul>

	<p>
		<strong>Firefox/geckodriver Note:</strong> There's an issue (<a
			href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1103196">Bug 1103196</a>) that
		prevents HTTPS sites from being used in versions &ge; 48 and &lt; 52.
	<p>
		<strong>PhantomJS Note:</strong> There's an issue (<a
			href="https://github.com/ariya/phantomjs/issues/11342">Issue #11342</a>) that prevents
		sites at localhost, 127.0.0.1 and ::1 from being proxied through ZAP. Until a fix is
		available is advised to not use it in those cases. Some add-ons might choose to show
		warning message when that happens. As workaround one could define, in the <code>hosts</code>
		file, a domain name mapping to the local address and use that domain name instead.
	<p>
		<strong>Internet Explorer Note:</strong> Not all versions of Internet Explorer work out
		of the box, refer to the <a
			href="https://code.google.com/p/selenium/wiki/InternetExplorerDriver#Required_Configuration">IEDriverServer
			website</a> for more details on how to configure them.
