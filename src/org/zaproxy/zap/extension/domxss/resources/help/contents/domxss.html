<H1>DOM XSS Active Scan Rule</H1>
<p>
An Active Scan rule for detecting DOM XSS vulnerabilities.
<p>
It launches browser windows and sends attack payloads to all of the relevant DOM elements.<br>
As it launches browser windows it is not suitable for headless environments,
and will take significantly longer than other (non browser based) rules. 
</p>
<p>
This version only supports Firefox.<br>
Future versions may support other browsers.
</p>
<p>
The following Attack Strengths are supported, and related directly to the number of attack payloads used:
<ul>
<li>LOW: 2 attack payloads 
<li>MEDIUM: 4 attack payloads 
<li>HIGH: 6 attack payloads 
<li>INSANE: 8 attack payloads 
</ul>
</p>
<p>
The rule will only report one DOM XSS vulnerability per node, unless the LOW Alert threshold
is used, in which case it will keep trying all of the specified payloads.
