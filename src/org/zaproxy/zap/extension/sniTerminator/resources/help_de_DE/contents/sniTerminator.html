<h1>SNI Terminator</h1>
<p>
SNI Terminator allows you to use ZAP as a transparent HTTPS proxy for clients which support SNI.
</p>
<p>
Since ZAP already works pretty well as a transparent HTTP proxy, this allows you to set up a testing LANs (or VMs) where all HTTP and HTTPS traffic is proxied regardless of software settings.
</p>
<p>
For example, if you have a Linux machine you use for testing, you can do something like the following to forward all HTTP and HTTPS traffic to your ZAP instance running on 192.168.0.14:<br>
<code>
iptables -t nat -A OUTPUT -p tcp --dport 443 -j DNAT --to-destination 192.168.0.14:8443<br>
iptables -t nat -A OUTPUT -p tcp --dport 80 -j DNAT --to-destination 192.168.0.14:8080
</code>
