<H1>Options Fuzzer screen</H1>
<p>
This screen allows you to configure the <a href="concepts.html">fuzzing</a> options:

<H3>Default category</H3>
The category that will be initially selected shown when the <a href="dialogue.html">Fuzz dialog</a> is displayed. 

<H3>Concurrent scanning threads per host</H3>
The number of threads the scanner will use per host.<br>
Increasing the number of threads will speed up the scan but may put extra strain on the computer ZAP is running on and the target host.

<H3>Add custom Fuzz file</H3>
Allows you to add your own files to be used when fuzzing.<br>
These should be text files with one attack per line.<br>
Files are added to the 'fuzzers' directory underneath the ZAP home directory.
