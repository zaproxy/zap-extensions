	The Fuzzer tab shows you the requests and responses performed when you
	<a href="../../start/concepts/fuzz.html">fuzz</a> a string.
	<br> Selecting a row see the full requests and responses. You can also search for
	strings in the fuzz results using the

	<H2>HTTP Fuzzer results</H2>
	The results have to be manually assessed to know if any vulnerability was found.
	<br> Meaning of values of the "State" column:
	<ul>
		<li>"Successful" - the message was successfully sent/received;</li>
		<li>"Error" - an error occurred while creating or sending/receiving the message
			(for example: malformed HTTP message, time out while reading the response);</li>
		<li>"Reflected" - the injected fuzz string (value of "Fuzz" column) was found in
			the response body.</li>
	</ul>

	<H2>Right click menu</H2>
	Right clicking on a row will bring up a menu which will allow you to:

	<H3>Exclude from</H3>
	This menu has the following submenus:

	<H4>Proxy</H4>
	This will exclude the selected nodes from the proxy. They will still be proxied via ZAP
	but will not be shown in any of the tabs.
	<br /> This can be used to ignore URLs that you know are not relevant to the system you

	<br /> The nodes can be included again via the
	<a href="../dialogs/session/sessprop.html">Session Properties</a> dialog

	<H4>Scanner</H4>

	after making any changes to it that you want to.
