Standalone scripts
==================

Scripts that are self contained and are only run when you start them manually. 

**Note**: "_Persona Create Account.zst_" will no longer work as of November 30th 2016, for more information see: [Identity/Persona Shutdown Guidelines for Reliers](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Identity/Persona_Shutdown_Guidelines_for_Reliers). The script is being kept in the repository as an example.
