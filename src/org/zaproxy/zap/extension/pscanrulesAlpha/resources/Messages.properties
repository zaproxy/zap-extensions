pscanalpha.insecureformload.name=HTTP to HTTPS Insecure Transition in Form Post
pscanalpha.insecureformload.desc=This check looks for insecure HTTP pages that host HTTPS forms. The issue is that an insecure HTTP page can easily be hijacked through MITM and the secure HTTPS form can be replaced or spoofed.
pscanalpha.insecureformload.refs=
pscanalpha.insecureformload.soln=Use HTTPS for landing pages that host secure forms.
pscanalpha.insecureformload.exploit=
pscanalpha.insecureformload.extrainfo=The response to the following request over HTTP included an HTTPS form tag action attribute value:\r\n\r\n{0}The context was:\r\n\r\n{1}

pscanalpha.insecureformpost.name=HTTPS to HTTP Insecure Transition in Form Post
pscanalpha.insecureformpost.desc=This check identifies secure HTTPS pages that host insecure HTTP forms. The issue is that a secure page is transitioning to an insecure page when data is uploaded through a form. The user may think they're submitting data to a secure page when in fact they are not.
pscanalpha.insecureformpost.refs=
pscanalpha.insecureformpost.soln=Ensure sensitive data is only sent over secured HTTPS channels.
pscanalpha.insecureformpost.exploit=
pscanalpha.insecureformpost.extrainfo=The response to the following request over HTTPS included an HTTP form tag action attribute value:\r\n\r\n{0}The context was:\r\n\r\n{1}

pscanalpha.usercontrolledcharset.name=User Controllable Charset
pscanalpha.usercontrolledcharset.desc=This check looks at user-supplied input in query string parameters and POST data to identify where Content-Type or meta tag charset declarations might be user-controlled. Such charset declarations should always be declared by the application. If an attacker can control the response charset, they could manipulate the HTML to perform XSS or other attacks.
pscanalpha.usercontrolledcharset.refs=
pscanalpha.usercontrolledcharset.soln=Force UTF-8 in all charset declarations. If user-input is required to decide a charset declaration, ensure that only an allowed list is used.
pscanalpha.usercontrolledcharset.exploit=An attacker controlling the <meta> element charset value is able to declare UTF-7 and is also able to include enough user-controlled payload early in the HTML document to have it interpreted as UTF-7. By encoding their payload with UTF-7 the attacker is able to bypass any server-side XSS protections and embed script in the page.
pscanalpha.usercontrolledcharset.extrainfo=A(n) [{0}] tag [{1}] attribute\r\n\r\nThe user input found was:\r\n{2}={3}\r\n\r\nThe charset value it controlled was:\r\n{4}

pscanalpha.usercontrolledcookie.name=Cookie Poisoning
pscanalpha.usercontrolledcookie.desc=This check looks at user-supplied input in query string parameters and POST data to identify where cookie parameters might be controlled. This is called a cookie poisoning attack, and becomes exploitable when an attacker can manipulate the cookie in various ways. In some cases this will not be exploitable, however, allowing URL parameters to set cookie values is generally considered a bug.
pscanalpha.usercontrolledcookie.refs=http://websecuritytool.codeplex.com/wikipage?title=Checks#user-controlled-cookie
pscanalpha.usercontrolledcookie.soln=Do not allow user input to control cookie names and values. If some query string parameters must be set in cookie values, be sure to filter out semicolon's that can serve as name/value pair delimiters.
pscanalpha.usercontrolledcookie.exploit.get=An attacker may be able to poison cookie values through URL parameters.  Try injecting a semicolon to see if you can add cookie values (e.g. name=controlledValue;name=anotherValue;).
pscanalpha.usercontrolledcookie.exploit.post=An attacker may be able to poison cookie values through POST parameters. To test if this is a more serious issue, you should try resending that request as a GET, with the POST parameter included as a query string parmeter. For example:  http://nottrusted.com/page?value=maliciousInput.\r\n\r\n
pscanalpha.usercontrolledcookie.extrainfo=This was identified at:\r\n\r\n{0}\r\n\r\nUser-input was found in the following cookie:\r\n{1}\r\n\r\nThe user input was:\r\n{2}={3}

pscanalpha.usercontrolledjavascriptevent.name=User Controllable JavaScript Event (XSS)
pscanalpha.usercontrolledjavascriptevent.desc=This check looks at user-supplied input in query string parameters and POST data to identify where certain HTML attribute values might be controlled. This provides hot-spot detection for XSS (cross-site scripting) that will require further review by a security analyst to determine exploitability.            
pscanalpha.usercontrolledjavascriptevent.refs=http://websecuritytool.codeplex.com/wikipage?title=Checks#user-javascript-event
pscanalpha.usercontrolledjavascriptevent.soln=Validate all input and sanitize output it before writing to any Javascript on* events.
pscanalpha.usercontrolledjavascriptevent.exploit=
pscanalpha.usercontrolledjavascriptevent.extrainfo=User-controlled javascript event(s) was found. Exploitability will need to be manually determined. The page at the following URL:\r\n\r\n{0}\"\r\n\r\nincludes the following Javascript event which may be attacker-controllable: \r\n\r\nUser-input was found in the following data of an [{1}] event:\r\n{2}\r\n\r\nThe user input was:\r\n{3}

pscanalpha.usercontrolledopenredirect.name=Open Redirect
pscanalpha.usercontrolledopenredirect.desc=Open redirects are one of the OWASP 2010 Top Ten vulnerabilities. This check looks at user-supplied input in query string parameters and POST data to identify where open redirects might be possible. Open redirects occur when an application allows user-supplied input (e.g. http://nottrusted.com) to control an offsite redirect. This is generally a pretty accurate way to find where 301 or 302 redirects could be exploited by spammers or phishing attacks
pscanalpha.usercontrolledopenredirect.soln=To avoid the open redirect vulnerability, parameters of the application script/program must be validated before sending 302 HTTP code (redirect) to the client browser. Implement safe redirect functionality that only redirects to relative URI's, or a list of trusted domains
pscanalpha.usercontrolledopenredirect.exploit=An attacker could supply a user with the following link: http://example.com/example.php?url=http://malicious.example.com
pscanalpha.usercontrolledopenredirect.refs=https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Open_redirect\nhttps://owasp.org/index.php/Top_10_2010-A10-Unvalidated_Redirects_and_Forwards\nhttps://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/601.html
pscanalpha.usercontrolledopenredirect.extrainfo.get=The 301 or 302 response to a request for the following URL appeared to contain user input in the location header:\r\n\r\n
pscanalpha.usercontrolledopenredirect.extrainfo.post=An open redirect controlled by POST parameters was detected. To test if this is a more serious issue, you should try resending that request as a GET, with the POST parameter included as a query string parameter. For example: http://nottrusted.com/page?url=http://lookout.net.\r\n\r\nThe 301 or 302 response to a request for the following URL appeared to contain user input in the location header:\r\n\r\n
pscanalpha.usercontrolledopenredirect.extrainfo.common={0}\r\n\r\nThe user input found was:\r\n\r\n{1}={2}\r\n\r\nThe context was:\r\n\r\n{3}

pscanalpha.directorybrowsing.extrainfo={0}

pscanalpha.heartbleed.name=Heartbleed OpenSSL Vulnerability (Indicative)
pscanalpha.heartbleed.desc=The TLS and DTLS implementations in OpenSSL 1.0.1 before 1.0.1g do not properly handle Heartbeat Extension packets, which allows remote attackers to obtain sensitive information from process memory via crafted packets that trigger a buffer over-read, potentially disclosing sensitive information.	
pscanalpha.heartbleed.soln=Update to OpenSSL 1.0.1g or later. Re-issue HTTPS certificates. Change asymmetric private keys and shared secret keys, since these may have been compromised, with no evidence of compromise in the server log files.
pscanalpha.heartbleed.refs=http://cvedetails.com/cve-details.php?t=1&cve_id=CVE-2014-0160
pscanalpha.heartbleed.extrainfo={0} is in use. Note however that the reported version could contain back-ported security fixes, and so the issue could be a false positive. This is common on Red Hat, for instance.

pscanalpha.crossdomain.name=Cross-Domain Misconfiguration
pscanalpha.crossdomain.desc=Web browser data loading may be possible, due to a Cross Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) misconfiguration on the web server
pscanalpha.crossdomain.soln=Ensure that sensitive data is not available in an unauthenticated manner (using IP address white-listing, for instance).\nConfigure the "Access-Control-Allow-Origin" HTTP header to a more restrictive set of domains, or remove all CORS headers entirely, to allow the web browser to enforce the Same Origin Policy (SOP) in a more restrictive manner.
pscanalpha.crossdomain.refs=http://www.hpenterprisesecurity.com/vulncat/en/vulncat/vb/html5_overly_permissive_cors_policy.html
pscanalpha.crossdomain.extrainfo=The CORS misconfiguration on the web server permits cross-domain read requests from arbitrary third party domains, using unauthenticated APIs on this domain. Web browser implementations do not permit arbitrary third parties to read the response from authenticated APIs, however. This reduces the risk somewhat. This misconfiguration could be used by an attacker to access data that is available in an unauthenticated manner, but which uses some other form of security, such as IP address white-listing.

pscanalpha.insecurecomponent.desc = Based on passive analysis of the response, insecure component {0} {1} appears to be in use.\nThe highest noted CVSS rating for this product version is {2}.\nIn total, {3} vulnerabilities were noted.\nSome Linux distributions such as Red Hat employ the practice of retaining old version numbers when security fixes are "backported".\nThese cases are noted as "False Positives", but should be manually verified.  
pscanalpha.insecurecomponent.refs = {0}
pscanalpha.insecurecomponent.soln = Upgrade from {0} {1} to the latest stable version of the product.\nUse a package manager and package management policies and procedures to manage the installed versions of software packages.

pscanalpha.bigredirectsscanner.name=Big Redirect Detected (Potential Sensitive Information Leak)
pscanalpha.bigredirectsscanner.desc=The server has responded with a redirect that seems to provide a large response. This may indicate that although the server sent a redirect it also responded with body content (which may include sensitive details, PII, etc).
pscanalpha.bigredirectsscanner.refs=
pscanalpha.bigredirectsscanner.soln=Ensure that no sensitive information is leaked via redirect responses. Redirect responses should have almost no content.
pscanalpha.bigredirectsscanner.extrainfo=Location header URI length: {0} [{1}].\nPredicted response size: {2}.\nResponse Body Length: {3}.


pscanalpha.storabilitycacheability.name = Content Cacheability

pscanalpha.nonstorable.name = Non-Storable Content
pscanalpha.nonstorable.desc = The response contents are not storable by caching components such as proxy servers. If the response does not contain sensitive, personal or user-specific information, it may benefit from being stored and cached, to improve performance.
pscanalpha.nonstorable.refs = https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7234\nhttps://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231\nhttp://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec13.html (obsoleted by rfc7234)
pscanalpha.nonstorable.soln = The content may be marked as storable by ensuring that the following conditions are satisfied:\nThe request method must be understood by the cache and defined as being cacheable ("GET", "HEAD", and "POST" are currently defined as cacheable)\nThe response status code must be understood by the cache (one of the 1XX, 2XX, 3XX, 4XX, or 5XX response classes are generally understood)\nThe "no-store" cache directive must not appear in the request or response header fields\nFor caching by "shared" caches such as "proxy" caches, the "private" response directive must not appear in the response\nFor caching by "shared" caches such as "proxy" caches, the "Authorization" header field must not appear in the request, unless the response explicitly allows it (using one of the "must-revalidate", "public", or "s-maxage" Cache-Control response directives)\nIn addition to the conditions above, at least one of the following conditions must also be satisfied by the response:\nIt must contain an "Expires" header field\nIt must contain a "max-age" response directive\nFor "shared" caches such as "proxy" caches, it must contain a "s-maxage" response directive\nIt must contain a "Cache Control Extension" that allows it to be cached\nIt must have a status code that is defined as cacheable by default (200, 203, 204, 206, 300, 301, 404, 405, 410, 414, 501).

pscanalpha.storablenoncacheable.name = Storable but Non-Cacheable Content
pscanalpha.storablenoncacheable.desc = The response contents are storable by caching components such as proxy servers, but will not be retrieved directly from the cache, without validating the request upstream, in response to similar requests from other users. 
pscanalpha.storablenoncacheable.refs = https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7234\nhttps://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231\nhttp://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec13.html (obsoleted by rfc7234)

pscanalpha.storablenoncacheable.extrainfo = {0}}

pscanalpha.storablecacheable.name = Storable and Cacheable Content
pscanalpha.storablecacheable.desc = The response contents are storable by caching components such as proxy servers, and may be retrieved directly from the cache, rather than from the origin server by the caching servers, in response to similar requests from other users.  If the response data is sensitive, personal or user-specific, this may result in sensitive information being leaked. In some cases, this may even result in a user gaining complete control of the session of another user, depending on the configuration of the caching components in use in their environment. This is primarily an issue where "shared" caching servers such as "proxy" caches are configured on the local network. This configuration is typically found in corporate or educational environments, for instance.
pscanalpha.storablecacheable.refs = https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7234\nhttps://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231\nhttp://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec13.html (obsoleted by rfc7234)
pscanalpha.storablecacheable.soln = Validate that the response does not contain sensitive, personal or user-specific information.  If it does, consider the use of the following HTTP response headers, to limit, or prevent the content being stored and retrieved from the cache by another user:\nCache-Control: no-cache, no-store, must-revalidate, private\nPragma: no-cache\nExpires: 0\nThis configuration directs both HTTP 1.0 and HTTP 1.1 compliant caching servers to not store the response, and to not retrieve the response (without validation) from the cache, in response to a similar request. 
pscanalpha.storablecacheable.extrainfo = {0}
pscanalpha.storablecacheable.otherinfo.liberallifetimeheuristic = In the absence of an explicitly specified caching lifetime directive in the response, a liberal lifetime heuristic of 1 year was assumed. This is permitted by rfc7234.
pscanalpha.storablecacheable.otherinfo.staleretrievenotblocked = The response is stale, and stale responses are not configured to be re-validated or blocked, using the 'must-revalidate', 'proxy-revalidate', 's-maxage', or 'max-age' response 'Cache-Control' directives.

pscanalpha.retrievedfromcache.name = Retrieved from Cache
pscanalpha.retrievedfromcache.desc = The content was retrieved from a shared cache. If the response data is sensitive, personal or user-specific, this may result in sensitive information being leaked. In some cases, this may even result in a user gaining complete control of the session of another user, depending on the configuration of the caching components in use in their environment. This is primarily an issue where caching servers such as "proxy" caches are configured on the local network. This configuration is typically found in corporate or educational environments, for instance.

pscanalpha.retrievedfromcache.extrainfo = {0}
pscanalpha.retrievedfromcache.extrainfo.http11ageheader = The presence of the 'Age' header indicates that that a HTTP/1.1 compliant caching server is in use.

pscanalpha.imagelocationscanner.name = Image Location Scanner
pscanalpha.imagelocationscanner.alerttitle = Image Contains Embedded Location Information
pscanalpha.imagelocationscanner.alertDetailPrefix = This image contains the following embedded location information:
pscanalpha.imagelocationscanner.desc = The image was found to contain embedded location information, such as GPS coordinates.  Depending on the context of the image in the website, this information may expose private details of the users of a site.  For example, a site that allows users to upload profile pictures taken in the home may expose the home's address.  
pscanalpha.imagelocationscanner.refs = http://www.veggiespam.com/ils/
pscanalpha.imagelecationscanner.soln = Before allowing images to be stored on the server and/or transmitted to the browser, strip out the embedded location information from image.  This could mean removing all Exif data or just the GPS component.

pscanalpha.xchromeloggerdata.name=X-ChromeLogger-Data (XCOLD) Header Information Leak
pscanalpha.xchromeloggerdata.desc=The server is leaking information through the X-ChromeLogger-Data (or X-ChromePhp-Date) response header. The content of such headers can be customized by the developer, however it is not uncommon to find: server file system locations, vhost declarations, etc.
pscanalpha.xchromeloggerdata.refs=https://craig.is/writing/chrome-logger
pscanalpha.xchromeloggerdata.soln=Disable this functionality in Production when it might leak information that could be leveraged by an attacker. Alternatively ensure that use of the functionality is tied to a strong authorization check and only available to administrators or support personnel for troubleshooting purposes not general users.
pscanalpha.xchromeloggerdata.otherinfo.msg=The following represents an attempt to base64 decode the value:
pscanalpha.xchromeloggerdata.otherinfo.error=Header value could not be base64 decoded:
