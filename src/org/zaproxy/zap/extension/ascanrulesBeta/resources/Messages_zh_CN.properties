ascanbeta.HTTPParamPoll.name=HTTP Parameter Pollution scanner
ascanbeta.HTTPParamPoll.desc=HTTP Parameter Pollution (HPP) attacks consist of injecting encoded query string delimiters into other existing parameters. If a web application does not properly sanitize the user input, a malicious user can compromise the logic of the application to perform either client-side or server-side attacks. One consequence of HPP attacks is that the attacker can potentially override existing hard-coded HTTP parameters to modify the behavior of an application, bypass input validation checkpoints, and access and possibly exploit variables that may be out of direct reach.

ascanbeta.insecurehttpmethod.desc=The insecure HTTP method [{0}] is enabled on the web server for this resource. Depending on the web server configuration, and the underlying implementation responsible for serving the resource, this might or might not be exploitable. The TRACK and TRACE methods may be used by an attacker, to gain access to the authorisation token/session cookie of an application user, even if the session cookie is protected using the ''HttpOnly'' flag. For the attack to be successful, the application user must typically be using an older web browser, or a web browser which has a Same Origin Policy (SOP) bypass vulnerability. The ''CONNECT'' method can be used by a web client to create an HTTP tunnel to third party websites or services.
ascanbeta.insecurehttpmethod.trace.exploitable.desc=The insecure HTTP method [{0}] is enabled for this resource, and is exploitable. The TRACK and TRACE methods may be used by an attacker, to gain access to the authorisation token/session cookie of an application user, even if the session cookie is protected using the ''HttpOnly'' flag.

ascanbeta.sessionfixation.name=Session Fixation
ascanbeta.sessionfixation.desc=Session Fixation may be possible. If this issue occurs with a login URL (where the user authenticates themselves to the application), then the URL may be given by an attacker, along with a fixed session id, to a victim, in order to later assume the identity of the victim using the given session id. If the issue occurs with a non-login page, the URL and fixed session id may only be used by an attacker to track an unauthenticated user's actions. If the vulnerability occurs on a cookie field or a form field (POST parameter) rather than on a URL (GET) parameter, then some other vulnerability may also be required in order to set the cookie field on the victim's browser, to allow the vulnerability to be exploited.
ascanbeta.sessionfixation.soln=1) Prevent the attacker from gaining a session id by enforcing strict session ids, and by only allocating session ids upon successful authentication to the application.\n2) The server should always create a new session id upon authentication, regardless of whether a session is already in place.\n3) Bind the session id to some identificable client attribute combination, such as IP address, SSL client certificate.\n4) Sessions, when destroyed, must be destroyed on the server, as well as on the client.\n5) Implement a logout mechanism which will destroy all previous sessions for the client.\n6) Implement absolute session timeouts.\n7)Switch from a URL based to a cookie or form based session id implementation, as the latter typically require additional vulnerabilities, in order to be exploitable by an attacker\n

ascanbeta.sqlinjection.soln=Do not trust client side input, even if there is client side validation in place. \nIn general, type check all data on the server side.\nIf the application uses JDBC, use PreparedStatement or CallableStatement, with parameters passed by '?'\nIf the application uses ASP, use ADO Command Objects with strong type checking and parameterized queries.\nIf database Stored Procedures can be used, use them.\nDo *not* concatenate strings into queries in the stored procedure, or use 'exec', 'exec immediate', or equivalent functionality\!\nDo not create dynamic SQL queries using simple string concatenation.\nEscape all data received from the client.\nApply a 'whitelist' of allowed characters, or a 'blacklist' of disallowed characters in user input.\nApply the privilege of least privilege by using the least privileged database user possible.\nIn particular, avoid using the 'sa' or 'db-owner' database users. This does not eliminate SQL injection, but minimizes its impact.\nGrant the minimum database access that is necessary for the application.

ascanbeta.sourcecodedisclosurecve-2012-1823.name=Source Code Disclosure - CVE-2012-1823
ascanbeta.sourcecodedisclosurecve-2012-1823.desc=Some PHP versions, when configured to run using CGI, do not correctly handle query strings that lack an unescaped "\=" character, enabling PHP source code disclosure, and arbitrary code execution. In this case, the contents of the PHP file were served directly to the web browser. This output will typically contain PHP, although it may also contain straight HTML.
ascanbeta.sourcecodedisclosurecve-2012-1823.soln=Upgrade to the latest stable version of PHP, or use the Apache web server and the mod_rewrite module to filter out malicious requests using the "RewriteCond" and "RewriteRule" directives.

ascanbeta.sourcecodedisclosure.svnbased.soln=Ensure that SVN metadata files are not deployed to the web server or application server

ascanbeta.sourcecodedisclosurewebinf.name=Source Code Disclosure - /WEB-INF folder
ascanbeta.sourcecodedisclosurewebinf.desc=Java source code was disclosed by the web server in Java class files in the WEB-INF folder. The class files can be dis-assembled to produce source code which very closely matches the original source code.  
ascanbeta.sourcecodedisclosurewebinf.soln=The web server should be configured to not serve the /WEB-INF folder or its contents to web browsers, since it contains sensitive information such as compiled Java source code and properties files which may contain credentials. Java classes deployed with the application should be obfuscated, as an additional layer of defence in a "defence-in-depth" approach.

ascanbeta.sourcecodedisclosurewebinf.propertiesfile.name=Properties File Disclosure - /WEB-INF folder
ascanbeta.sourcecodedisclosurewebinf.propertiesfile.desc=A Java class in the /WEB-INF folder disclosed the presence of the properties file. Properties file are not intended to be publicly accessible, and typically contain configuration information, application credentials, or cryptographic keys.   
ascanbeta.sourcecodedisclosurewebinf.propertiesfile.soln=The web server should be configured to not serve the /WEB-INF folder or its contents to web browsers.  It may also be possible to remove the /WEB-INF folder.  
ascanbeta.sourcecodedisclosurewebinf.propertiesfile.extrainfo=The reference to the properties file was found in the dis-assembled Java source code for Java class [{0}].

ascanbeta.usernameenumeration.name=Possible Username Enumeration
ascanbeta.usernameenumeration.desc=It may be possible to enumerate usernames, based on differing HTTP responses when valid and invalid usernames are provided. This would greatly increase the probability of success of password brute-forcing attacks against the system. Note that false positives may sometimes be minimised by increasing the 'Attack Strength' Option in ZAP.  Please manually check the 'Other Info' field to confirm if this is actually an issue. 
ascanbeta.usernameenumeration.soln=Do not divulge details of whether a username is valid or invalid. In particular, for unsuccessful login attempts, do not differentiate between an invalid user and an invalid password in the error message, page title, page contents, HTTP headers, or redirection logic.

ascanbeta.usernameenumeration.alert.attack=Manipulate [{0}] field\: [{1}] and monitor the output 

ascanbeta.paddingoracle.name=Generic Padding Oracle
ascanbeta.paddingoracle.desc=By manipulating the padding on an encrypted string, an attacker is able to generate an error message that indicates a likely 'padding oracle' vulnerability. Such a vulnerability can affect any application or framework that uses encryption improperly, such as some versions of ASP.net, Java Server Faces, and Mono. An attacker may exploit this issue to decrypt data and recover encryption keys, potentially viewing and modifying confidential data. This plugin should detect the MS10-070 padding oracle vulnerability in ASP.net if CustomErrors are enabled for that.
ascanbeta.paddingoracle.soln=Update the affected server software, or modify the scripts so that they properly validate encrypted data before attempting decryption.
