<H1>Active Scan Rules - alpha</H1>
The following alpha quality active scan rules are included in this add-on:

<H2>Backup File Disclosure</H2>
Scans for commonly-named backup copies of files on the web server, which may reveal sensitive information

<H2>Cookie Slack Detector</H2>
Tests cookies to detect if some have no effect on response size when omitted, especially cookies containing the name "session" or "userid"

<H2>Cross-Domain Misconfiguration</H2>
Checks if the web server is configured to allow Cross Domain access, from a malicious</br> 
third party service, for instance. Currently checks for wildcards in Adobe's crossdomain.xml, and in</br> 
SilverLight's clientaccesspolicy.xml. 

<H2>Example File Active Scanner</H2>
This implements an example active scan rule that loads strings from a file that the user can edit.<br>

<H2>Example Simple Active Scanner</H2>
This implements a very simple example active scan rule.<br>

<H2>Expression Language Injection</H2>
The software constructs all or part of an expression language (EL) statement in a Java Server Page (JSP) using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the intended EL statement before it is executed. In certain versions of Spring 3.0.5 and earlier, there was a vulnerability (CVE-2011-2730) in which Expression Language tags would be evaluated twice, which effectively exposed any application to EL injection. However, even for later versions, this weakness is still possible depending on configuration.

<H2>Heartbleed OpenSSL Vulnerability</H2>
Detects if the web server is vulnerable to the Heartbleed OpenSSL Vulnerability, by exploiting it.

<H2>Insecure HTTP Method</H2>
Detects (and exploits, depending on the scan settings) known insecure HTTP methods enabled for the URL.

<H2>Remote Code Execution - CVE-2012-1823</H2>
Detect CVE-2012-1823 to perform Remote Code Execution on a PHP-CGI based web server.

<H2>ShellShock - CVE-2014-6271</H2>

This scanner perform 2 attacks to detect servers vulnerable to CVE-2014-6271 aka ShellShock.<br>
The first is a simple reflected attack and the second is a time based attack.

<H2>Source Code Disclosure - CVE-2012-1823</H2>
Exploit CVE-2012-1823 to disclose server-side PHP source code on a PHP-CGI based web server.

<H2>Source Code Disclosure - File Inclusion</H2>
Uses local file inclusion techniques to scan for files containing source code on the web server.

<H2>Source Code Disclosure - Git</H2>
Uses Git source code repository metadata to scan for files containing source code on the web server.

<H2>Source Code Disclosure - SVN</H2>
Uses Subversion source code repository metadata to scan for files containing source code on the web server.

<H2>Source Code Disclosure - /WEB-INF</H2>
Exploit the presence of an unprotected /WEB-INF folder to download and decompile Java classes, to disclose Java source code.

<H2>HTTPS As HTTP Scanner</H2>
This active scanner attempts to access content that was originally accessed via HTTPS (SSL/TLS) via HTTP.
