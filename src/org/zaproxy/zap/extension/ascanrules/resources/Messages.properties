ascanrules.desc = Active Scan Rules

ascanrules.bufferoverflow.name = Buffer Overflow
ascanrules.bufferoverflow.desc = Buffer overflow errors are characterized by the overwriting of memory spaces of the background web process, which should have never been modified intentionally or unintentionally. Overwriting values of the IP (Instruction Pointer), BP (Base Pointer) and other registers causes exceptions, segmentation faults, and other process errors to occur. Usually these errors end execution of the application in an unexpected way. 
ascanrules.bufferoverflow.soln = Rewrite the background program using proper return length checking.  This will require a recompile of the background executable.
ascanrules.bufferoverflow.refs = https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Buffer_overflow_attack
ascanrules.bufferoverflow.other = Potential Buffer Overflow.  The script closed the connection and threw a 500 Internal Server Error


ascanrules.commandinjectionplugin.name=Remote OS Command Injection
ascanrules.commandinjectionplugin.desc=Attack technique used for unauthorized execution of operating system commands.

ascanrules.commandinjectionplugin.refs=http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/78.html\nhttps://www.owasp.org/index.php/Command_Injection

ascanrules.formatstring.name=Format String Error
ascanrules.formatstring.desc=A Format String error occurs when the submitted data of an input string is evaluated as a command by the application. 
ascanrules.formatstring.soln= Rewrite the background program using proper deletion of bad character strings.  This will require a recompile of the background executable.
ascanrules.formatstring.refs=https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Format_string_attack
ascanrules.formatstring.error1 = Potential Format String Error.  The script closed the connection on a /%s

ascanrules.testsqlinjection.desc=SQL injection may be possible.
ascanrules.testsqlinjection.soln=Do not trust client side input, even if there is client side validation in place.  \nIn general, type check all data on the server side.\nIf the application uses JDBC, use PreparedStatement or CallableStatement, with parameters passed by '?'\nIf the application uses ASP, use ADO Command Objects with strong type checking and parameterized queries.\nIf database Stored Procedures can be used, use them.\nDo *not* concatenate strings into queries in the stored procedure, or use 'exec', 'exec immediate', or equivalent functionality!\nDo not create dynamic SQL queries using simple string concatenation.\nEscape all data received from the client.\nApply a 'whitelist' of allowed characters, or a 'blacklist' of disallowed characters in user input.\nApply the principle of least privilege by using the least privileged database user possible.\nIn particular, avoid using the 'sa' or 'db-owner' database users. This does not eliminate SQL injection, but minimizes its impact.\nGrant the minimum database access that is necessary for the application.

ascanrules.insecurehttpmethod.name = Insecure HTTP Method
ascanrules.insecurehttpmethod.detailed.name = Insecure HTTP Method - {0}
ascanrules.insecurehttpmethod.desc = The insecure HTTP method [{0}] is enabled on the web server for this resource. Depending on the web server configuration, and the underlying implementation responsible for serving the resource, this might or might not be exploitable. The TRACK and TRACE methods may be used by an attacker, to gain access to the authorisation token/session cookie of an application user, even if the session cookie is protected using the 'HttpOnly' flag. For the attack to be successful, the application user must typically be using an older web browser, or a web browser which has a Same Origin Policy (SOP) bypass vulnerability. The 'CONNECT' method can be used by a web client to create an HTTP tunnel to third party websites or services.
ascanrules.insecurehttpmethod.trace.exploitable.desc = The insecure HTTP method [{0}] is enabled for this resource, and is exploitable. The TRACK and TRACE methods may be used by an attacker, to gain access to the authorisation token/session cookie of an application user, even if the session cookie is protected using the 'HttpOnly' flag. For the attack to be successful, the application user must typically be using an older web browser, or a web browser which has a Same Origin Policy (SOP) bypass vulnerability.
ascanrules.insecurehttpmethod.trace.exploitable.extrainfo = A TRACE request was sent for this request, with a custom cookie value [{0}]. This cookie value was disclosed in the HTTP response, confirming the vulnerability.
ascanrules.insecurehttpmethod.connect.exploitable.desc = The insecure HTTP method [{0}] is enabled for this resource, and is exploitable. It was found to be possible to establish a tunneled socket connection to a third party service, using this HTTP method.  This would allow the service to be used as an anonymous spam relay, or as a web proxy, bypassing network restrictions. It also allows it to be used to establish a tunneled VPN, effectively extending the network perimeter to include untrusted components. 
ascanrules.insecurehttpmethod.extrainfo = The OPTIONS method disclosed the following enabled HTTP methods for this resource: [{0}]
ascanrules.insecurehttpmethod.connect.exploitable.extrainfo = The CONNECT method was used to establish a socket connection to [{0}], via the web server.
ascanrules.insecurehttpmethod.soln = Disable insecure methods such as TRACK, TRACE, and CONNECT on the web server, and ensure that the underlying service implementation does not support insecure methods.
ascanrules.insecurehttpmethod.delete.exploitable.desc = This method was originally intended for file managemant operations.

ascanrules.insecurehttpmethod.put.exploitable.desc = This method was originally intended for file managemant operations. It is now most commonly used in REST services, PUT is most-often utilized for **update** capabilities, PUT-ing to a known resource URI with the request body containing the newly-updated representation of the original resource..
ascanrules.insecurehttpmethod.put.exploitable.extrainfo = See the discussion on stackexchange: https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/21413/how-to-exploit-http-methods, for understanding REST operations see http://www.restapitutorial.com/lessons/httpmethods.html
ascanrules.insecurehttpmethod.patch.exploitable.desc = This method is now most commonly used in REST services, PATCH is used for **modify** capabilities. The PATCH request only needs to contain the changes to the resource, not the complete resource.
ascanrules.insecurehttpmethod.patch.exploitable.extrainfo = See the discussion on stackexchange: https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/21413/how-to-exploit-http-methods, for understanding REST operations see http://www.restapitutorial.com/lessons/httpmethods.html
ascanrules.insecurehttpmethod.webdav.exploitable.desc = This HTTP method is a WEBDAV method: {0}. If this server is not offering any WEBDAV services, these methods should not be available.
