<H1>Quick Start</H1>
<p>
	The Quick Start tab provides you with an easy way to quickly test a web application.
</p>
<p>
	Enter the URL of your target application and press the 'Attack' button.
</p>
<p>
	ZAP will spider the target and then attack it with the active scanner.
</p>
<p>
	For a more in depth test you should explore your application using your browser or 
	automated regression tests while proxying through ZAP.
</p>
<H2>Launch Browser</H2>
As long as you have the Selenium add-on installed then you will see an option to launch browsers.<br>
Select the browser you want from the pull-down and press the 'Launch Browser' button.<br>
Browsers launched this way will be configured to proxy via ZAP and will ignore certificate errors,
so you will not need to import the ZAP Root CA Certificate.<br>
ZAP will remember the last browser you chose when you restart it.<br><br>
A button will also be added to the toolbar which will launch the latest browser chosen. 
The icon will change to represent the relevant browser <br><br> 
Note that launched browsers will stop working if you change the address or port that ZAP is listening on.
