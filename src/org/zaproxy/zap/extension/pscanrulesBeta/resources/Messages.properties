pscanbeta.authenticationcredentialscaptured.name=Authentication Credentials Captured
pscanbeta.authenticationcredentialscaptured.desc=An insecure authentication mechanism is in use.  This allows an attacker on the network access to the userid and password of the authenticated user. For Basic Authentication, the attacker must merely monitor the network traffic until a Basic Authentication request is received, and then base64 decode the username and password.  For Digest Authentication, the attacker has access to the username, and possibly also the password, if the hash (including a nonce) can be successfully cracked, or if a Man-In-The-Middle attack is mounted.     
pscanbeta.authenticationcredentialscaptured.soln=Use HTTPS, and use a secure authentication mechanism that does not transmit the userid or password in an un-encrypted fashion.  In particular, avoid use of the Basic Authentication mechanism, since this trivial obfuscation mechanism is easily broken.

pscanbeta.authenticationcredentialscaptured.alert.basicauth.extrainfo=[{0}] [{1}] uses insecure authentication mechanism [{2}], revealing username [{3}] and password [{4}].
pscanbeta.authenticationcredentialscaptured.alert.digestauth.extrainfo=[{0}] [{1}] uses insecure authentication mechanism [{2}], revealing username [{3}] and additional information [{4}].
pscanbeta.authenticationcredentialscaptured.alert.attack=The attacker eavesdrops on the network until an authentication has completed.

pscanbeta.charsetmismatch.name=Charset Mismatch
pscanbeta.charsetmismatch.variant.no_mismatch_metacontenttype_missing=(Meta Content-Type Charset Missing)
pscanbeta.charsetmismatch.variant.header_metacontentype_mismatch=(Header Versus Meta Content-Type Charset)
pscanbeta.charsetmismatch.variant.header_metacharset_mismatch=(Header Versus Meta Charset)
pscanbeta.charsetmismatch.variant.metacontenttype_metacharset_mismatch=(Meta Charset Versus Meta Content-Type Charset)
pscanbeta.charsetmismatch.desc=This check identifies responses where the HTTP Content-Type header declares a charset different from the charset defined by the body of the HTML or XML. When there's a charset mismatch between the HTTP header and content body Web browsers can be forced into an undesirable content-sniffing mode to determine the content's correct character set.
pscanbeta.charsetmismatch.soln=Force UTF-8 for all text content in both the HTTP header and meta tags in HTML or encoding declarations in XML.
pscanbeta.charsetmismatch.exploit=An attacker could manipulate content on the page to be interpreted in an encoding of their choice. For example, if an attacker can control content at the beginning of the page, they could inject script using UTF-7 encoded text and manipulate some browsers into interpreting that text.
pscanbeta.charsetmismatch.refs=http://code.google.com/p/browsersec/wiki/Part2#Character_set_handling_and_detection
pscanbeta.charsetmismatch.extrainfo.html.no_mismatch_metacontenttype_missing=Charset is defined only by META charset, older clients that expect character set to be defined by META content-type may not correctly display this content.
pscanbeta.charsetmismatch.extrainfo.html.header_metacontentype_mismatch=There was a charset mismatch between the HTTP Header and the META content-type encoding declarations: [{0}] and [{1}] do not match.
pscanbeta.charsetmismatch.extrainfo.html.header_metacharset_mismatch=There was a charset mismatch between the HTTP Header and the META charset encoding declaration: [{0}] and [{1}] do not match.
pscanbeta.charsetmismatch.extrainfo.html.metacontenttype_metacharset_mismatch=There was a charset mismatch between the META charset and the META content-type encoding declaration: [{0}] and [{1}] do not match.
pscanbeta.charsetmismatch.extrainfo.xml=There was a charset mismatch between the HTTP Header and the XML encoding declaration: [{0}] and [{1}] do not match.

pscanbeta.cookielooselyscoped.name=Loosely Scoped Cookie
pscanbeta.cookielooselyscoped.desc=Cookies can be scoped by domain or path. This check is only concerned with domain scope.The domain scope applied to a cookie determines which domains can access it. For example, a cookie can be scoped strictly to a subdomain e.g. www.nottrusted.com, or loosely scoped to a parent domain e.g. nottrusted.com. In the latter case, any subdomain of nottrusted.com can access the cookie. Loosely scoped cookies are common in mega-applications like google.com and live.com.
pscanbeta.cookielooselyscoped.soln=Always scope cookies to a FQDN (Fully Qualified Domain Name).
pscanbeta.cookielooselyscoped.exploit=Cookies set from a subdomain like app.foo.bar are transmitted only to that domain by the browser. However, cookies scoped to a parent-level domain may be transmitted to the parent, or any subdomain of the parent.
pscanbeta.cookielooselyscoped.refs=http://code.google.com/p/browsersec/wiki/Part2#Same-origin_policy_for_cookies
pscanbeta.cookielooselyscoped.extrainfo=The origin domain used for comparison was: \r\n{0}\r\n{1}
pscanbeta.cookielooselyscoped.extrainfo.cookie={0}\r\n
