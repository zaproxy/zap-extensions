	<H1>Options AJAX Spider screen</H1>

	This screen allows you to configure the
	<a href="concepts.html">AJAX Spider</a> options. The AJAX Spider is an add-on for a
	crawler called Crawljax. The add-on sets up a local proxy in ZAP to talk to Crawljax.
	The AJAX Spider allows you to crawl web applications written in AJAX in far more depth than
	the native Spider. Use the AJAX Spider if you may have web applications written in AJAX. You should also use
	the native Spider as well for complete coverage of a web application (e.g., to cover HTML comments).

		<tr><td>Browser</td>
	    <td>AJAX Spider relies on an external browser to crawl the targeted site. You can
		specify which one you want to use:
				<ul>
					<li>Firefox;</li>
					<li>Chrome - requires ChromeDriver, if not on the system's PATH, it can be set with the
						option "Select ChromeDriver". For more information on ChromeDriver and how to obtain
						it refer to https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/</li>
					<li>HtmlUnit - is an embedded Java based browser included in AJAX Spider;</li>
					<li>PhantomJS - requires PhantomJS binary, if not on the system's PATH, it can
						be set with the option "Select PhantomJS binary". For more information on PhantomJS
						and how to obtain it refer to http://phantomjs.org/ (see footer note for caveat when
						using PhantomJS).</li>
					<li>Internet Explorer - requires IEDriverServer, if not on the system's PATH, it
						can be set with option "Select IEDriverServer". For more information on
						IEDriverServer refer to
						https://code.google.com/p/selenium/wiki/InternetExplorerDriver (see footer note for
						caveat when using Internet Explorer).</li>
				</ul>If you use Firefox, Chrome or Internet Explorer, you must have it installed in your system.

		<strong>PhantomJS Note:</strong> When PhantomJS is selected it will not be possible to
		spider sites at localhost, 127.0.0.1 and ::1 because of an issue in PhantomJS
		(https://github.com/ariya/phantomjs/issues/11342 ). Until a fix is issued a warning
		message will be shown.
	<p>
		<strong>Internet Explorer Note:</strong> Not all versions of Internet Explorer work out
		of the box, refer to
